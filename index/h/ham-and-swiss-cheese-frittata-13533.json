        "In a 9-inch non-stick skillet cook the onion and the bell pepper with salt and pepper to taste in 1 tablespoon of the oil over moderately low heat, stirring, until the bell pepper is tender. In a bowl whisk together the eggs, the ham, 1/3 cup of the Swiss cheese, and salt and pepper to taste, add the bell pepper mixture, and stir the mixture until it is combined well. In the skillet heat the remaining 1/2 tablespoon oil over moderate heat until it is hot but not smoking, pour in the mixture, distributing the ham and bell pepper evenly, and cook the frittata, without stirring, for 8 to 10 minutes, or until the edge is set but the center is still soft. Sprinkle the remaining 1/3 cup Swiss cheese over the top. (If the skillet handle is plastic, wrap it in a double thickness of foil.) Broil the frittata under a preheated broiler and about 4 inches from the heat for 2 to 3 minutes, or until the cheese is golden, and let cool in the skillet for 5 minutes. Slide the frittata onto a serving plate, cut it into wedges, and serve it warm or at room temperature."
