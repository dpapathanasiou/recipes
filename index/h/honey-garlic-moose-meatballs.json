        "While the sauce is simmering, roll the ground moose into meatballs in 2 tablespoon portions.  Heat the canola oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.  Cook the meatballs in batches until well browned, and cooked through, 10 to 15 minutes; drain well.",
        "Place the drained meatballs into a baking dish.  Pour on the sauce, and stir until well coated.  Bake in preheated oven for about 20 minutes so the meatballs absorb some of the sauce."
