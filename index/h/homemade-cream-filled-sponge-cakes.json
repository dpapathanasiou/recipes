        "Wrap the foil partially around a spice jar lengthwise, bringing foil up around the jar and crushing the foil around the ends of the jar to make a boat-shaped baking form about 4 inches long, 2 1/2 inches tall, and 1 1/2 inch wide. Repeat with 15 more pieces of foil to make 16 boat-shaped baking forms. Shape the bottoms of the forms to be slightly flat so forms can stand up.",

        "With a sharp knife, cut a 2-inch slit lengthwise on the flat bottom side of a cake.",
        "Pipe a generous amount of the frosting into the slit, holding the shape of the cake with your hand to prevent splitting. Repeat with the remaining cakes.",
        "For the coconut-raspberry variation: Bring 2 cups water and raspberry gelatin mix to a boil in a saucepan until the gelatin dissolves, about 5 minutes.",
        "Pour mixture into a shallow dish and refrigerate until thickened but not set, about 15 minutes.",
        "Place coconut flakes in a food processor. Pulse until flakes are finely chopped.",
        "Transfer the coconut to a shallow dish and stir in enough cornstarch to achieve a loose texture.",
        "Dip a filled cake in the thickened gelatin, turning to coat all sides; roll the cake in the coconut mixture. Repeat with remaining cakes.",
        "Arrange the coconut-coated cakes on a wire rack until gelatin and coconut are set, about 2 hours."
