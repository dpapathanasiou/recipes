        "Slice potatoes into French fries, and place into cold water so they won't turn brown while you prepare the oil.",
        "Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. While the oil is heating, sift the flour, garlic salt, onion salt, (regular) salt, and paprika into a large bowl. Gradually stir in enough water so that the mixture can be drizzled from a spoon.",
        "Dip potato slices into the batter one at a time, and place in the hot oil so they are not touching at first. The fries must be placed into the skillet one at a time, or they will clump together.  Fry until golden brown and crispy. Remove and drain on paper  towels."
