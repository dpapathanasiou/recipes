    "directions": [
        "Pat the pork chops dry with paper towels, and sprinkle both sides with salt and black pepper. Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat, and brown the chops well on both sides, about 5 minutes per side.",
        "Stir in honey, apricots, and garlic; cover, and simmer until the pork is tender, about 8 minutes. An instant-read thermometer, inserted into the center of a chop, should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).  Sprinkle with parsley, and serve chops topped with the apricots and pan juices."
