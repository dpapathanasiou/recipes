        "Bring the sugar, butter, and corn syrup to a boil in a saucepan stirring constantly. Remove from the heat and stir the flour mixture into the saucepan. Add the almond extract and continue stirring until incorporated. Measuring the batter by tablespoons, drop four cookies onto the prepared baking sheet. Spread each tablespoon of batter into a 4-inch circle.",

Use a spatula to remove the cookies from the baking sheet; place each cookie onto an inverted custard cup. Allow the cookies to cool while continuing to bake the remaining batter in batches."
