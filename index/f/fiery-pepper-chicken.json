        "Stir together 1 teaspoon cooking wine and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a bowl; add the chicken and stir to coat. Allow to marinate 2 to 3 minutes. Place the marinated chicken in a large, sealable plastic bag with the cornstarch and shake to coat.",
        "Heat the peanut oil in a wok or large skillet over high heat. Fry the chicken in the oil until it begins to crisp around the edges, 7 to 10 minutes. Remove the chicken to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Reserve 2 tablespoons of the oil, discarding the rest.",
        "Reheat the reserved oil in the wok over medium-high heat; cook and stir the garlic, ginger, and green onions in the oil until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the green chilies, crushed dried chilies, and Szechuan peppercorns; continue frying about 20 seconds more. Return the chicken to the wok; stir in the soy sauce, 2 teaspoons cooking wine, sugar, and 1/2 teaspoon salt until thoroughly combined. Remove from heat and serve immediately."
