        "Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Roll the dough into walnut sized balls. Flatten each ball in the palms of your hands to 1/4 inch thickness. Place a small amount of apricot preserves into the center, then fold the circle in half, and pinch the edges to seal. If the edges are not sealed, the preserves will leak out. Place filled cookies onto a greased baking sheet.",
