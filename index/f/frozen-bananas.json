        "Melt the chocolate in the top of a double boiler over just-barely simmering water, stirring frequently and scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula to avoid scorching.",
        "Dip each frozen banana in the melted chocolate, spooning the chocolate over the banana to cover it completely.  Roll the dipped bananas in the chopped peanuts and place on the wax paper covered baking sheet; freeze until the chocolate is firm, about 1 to 2 hours."
