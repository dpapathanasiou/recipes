        "Soak the beans overnight in cold water, then drain. Simmer them with the carrot, celery and 1/2 onion in salted water until just tender (25-30 minutes). Drain; remove the carrot, celery and onion and stir the French dressing into the beans. Chill for several hours, stirring occasionally to distribute the marinade.",
        "When ready to serve, taste for salt, then put the beans in a bowl and sprinkle with minced onion, the herbs and fresh ground pepper. This salad is usually served as a salad hors d'oeuvre. It fits well in a salad supper, as accompaniment to cold cuts and sliced tomatoes."
