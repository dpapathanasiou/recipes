        "Toast bread; butter lightly. Heat heavy large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Cook pancetta over medium heat until crisp. Transfer to paper towels to drain. Crack eggs into drippings in same skillet, keeping yolks whole. Cook until edges are opaque and whites are nearly set, about 3 minutes. Carefully turn eggs over. Cook until whites are set, about 1 minute. Put each egg on slice of toast. Add arugula to same skillet. Cook until just beginning to wilt, about 30 seconds. Top eggs with cheese, then pancetta and arugula. Top with remaining slices of toast and serve."
