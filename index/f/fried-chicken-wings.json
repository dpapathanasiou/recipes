        "Season chicken wings lightly with seasoned salt.",

        "Dredge wings again in flour mixture and return to the plate. Refrigerate wings again 15 to 30 minutes.",
        "Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).",
        "Fry chicken wings in hot oil until crisp and no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, 9 to 12 minutes.  An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the meat, near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).",
        "Transfer fried wings to a large stainless steel bowl. Drizzle sauce over the wings and toss to coat."
