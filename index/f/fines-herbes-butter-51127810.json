Add a tablespoon of chopped fresh chervil, tarragon, basil, dill, thyme, or sorrel (either a single herb or in any combination) and chop again to blend the flavors. Put in a bowl and mix in 1 teaspoon salt and 1 teaspoon anchovy paste. Add 1 cup (2 sticks) softened unsalted butter until the herbs have been thoroughly blended and the butter is completely green. [Editor: Melt a tablespoon of this butter on top of grilled lamb chops or fish, or stir into plain cooked vegetables.]"
