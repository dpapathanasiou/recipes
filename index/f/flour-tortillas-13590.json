        "In a bowl blend the flour and the shortening until the mixture resembles fine meal. In a small bowl stir together the salt and 2/3 cup warm water, add the salted water to the flour mixture, and toss the mixture until the liquid is incorporated. Form the dough into a ball and knead it on a lightly floured surface for 2 to 3 minutes, or until it is smooth. Divide the dough into 12 equal pieces (or 4 equal pieces for 10-inch tortillas), form each piece into a ball, and let the dough stand, covered with plastic wrap, for at least 30 minutes and up to 1 hour. Heat a griddle over moderately high heat until it is hot, on a lightly floured surface roll 1 of the balls of dough into a 7- or 10-inch round, and on the griddle cook the tortilla, turning it once, for 1 to 1 1/2 minutes, or until it is puffy and golden on both sides. Wrap the tortilla in a kitchen towel and make tortillas with the remaining dough in the same manner, stacking and enclosing them in the towel as they are done. The tortillas may be made 1 day in advance and kept chilled in a plastic bag."
