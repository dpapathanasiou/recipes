        "Using on/off turns, blend first 3 ingredients in processor until moist clumps form. Gather dough into ball; divide in half. Flatten each dough piece into thin rectangle. Wrap in plastic; chill until firm enough to roll, about 15 minutes.",
        "Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F. Roll out 1 dough piece on lightly floured surface to 14x10-inch rectangle. Spread with 1 cup preserves, then sprinkle with 1 cup coconut, 1 cup walnuts and 1/2 cup raisins. Starting at 1 long side, roll up dough jelly-roll style, enclosing filling. Push ends in to compress log to 12-inch length; seal ends. Transfer strudel to baking sheet, seam side down. Repeat with remaining dough and filling.",
        "Bake strudels until golden, about 45 minutes. Slide spatula under hot strudels to loosen from sheet. Let cool on sheet. Cut strudels crosswise into 3/4-inch-thick slices. (Store airtight for up to 3 days.)"
