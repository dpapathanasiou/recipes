        "Line a tray with a dry kitchen towel. Arrange first rolled out pasta sheet, which will have dried slightly but should still be soft, on a work surface and cut lengthwise at about 1/2-inch intervals, alternately using a plain pastry wheel and a fluted pastry wheel. (Each ribbon of trenette should have 1 straight side and 1 fluted side.) Toss trenette generously with flour. Form pasta loosely into nest and arrange on kitchen-towel-lined tray. Make more trenette with remaining dough in same manner. Trenette may be made 1 day ahead and chilled on towel-lined tray, covered loosely with plastic wrap."
