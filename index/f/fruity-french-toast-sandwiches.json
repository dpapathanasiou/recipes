        "Whisk milk, egg, vanilla extract, and cinnamon together in a bowl until frothy. Dip bread slices into egg mixture until evenly coated on each side.",
        "Heat non-stick skillet over medium heat until water drops \"skitter\" across its surface; add coated bread slices in single layer. Cook, turning frequently to avoid burning, until golden but not yet brown, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Spoon cream cheese mixture onto 1 slice; cover with second slice. Continue to cook until brown, 1 to 2 minutes more per side."
