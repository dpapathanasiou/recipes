        "Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).",
        "Sprinkle sea salt and ground black pepper into the bottom of a baking dish. Put squash halves into the baking dish with the cut sides facing downward. Pour enough water into the pan to be about 1/4-inch deep.",
        "Roast squash in preheated oven until flesh is tender, 60 to 90 minutes. Shred the flesh from the squash into strands and to a colander to drain excess liquid.",
        "Beat eggs, Parmesan cheese, and 3 tablespoons parsley together in a bowl.",
        "Put bacon into a skillet and place over medium heat; cook and stir until browned but not yet crisp, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain excess fat from the pan, retaining about 2 tablespoons. Cook and stir leek with the bacon until soft, about 2 minutes. Add garlic and continue to cook until fragrant, about 1 minute more.",
        "Pour white wine over the bacon mixture; cook until most of the liquid evaporates, about 5 minutes. Stir squash into the bacon mixture; cook and stir until any remaining moisture from the squash evaporates, 2 to 3 minutes.",
        "Gently stir the egg mixture into the squash mixture; cook until the liquid makes a creamy sauce and is heated through, 2 to 3 minutes more. Season with pepper. Garnish with parsley and Parmesan cheese."
