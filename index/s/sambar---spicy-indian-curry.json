        "Place 2 cups water, cabbage, carrot, green beans, bell pepper, and yellow split peas in a pressure cooker; lock lid. Bring cooker up to pressure and cook until peas are tender, 6 to 8 minutes. If your pressure cooker does not have a quick-release function, reduce cooking times slightly as food will continue to cook while pressure releases slowly. Drain and reserve excess liquid; set vegetables aside.",

        "Heat vegetable oil in a skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir cumin seeds and mustard seeds until seeds sputter, about 1 minute; add asafoetida powder. Stir in the sambar paste; cook and stir until thickened, about 1 minute. Season with turmeric, and stir in vegetables. If vegetable mixture is too thick, stir in reserved cooking liquid.",
