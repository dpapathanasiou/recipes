        "Heat the olive oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Stir in the onions, celery, and potatoes. Cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 10 minutes. Pour in the wine, lemon juice, and bay leaf. Bring to a boil over high heat and boil until the wine has reduced by half.",
        "Pour in the chicken broth and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer partially covered for 40 minutes until the vegetables are very tender. Remove the bay leaf and discard.",
        "Pour the soup into a blender, filling the pitcher no more than halfway full. Hold down the lid of the blender with a folded kitchen towel, and carefully start the blender, using a few quick pulses to get the soup moving before leaving it on to puree. Puree in batches until smooth and pour into a clean pot. Alternately, you can use a stick blender and puree the soup right in the cooking pot. Once pureed, stir in the thyme, basil, and parsley. Return to a simmer over medium heat and cook for 5 minutes to infuse the flavor of the herbs. Season to taste with salt and pepper before serving."
