        "In a large bowl, beat 1/2 cup butter with 3/4 cup sugar until light and fluffy.  Beat in eggs, and stir in vanilla and lemon zest. Fold in dry ingredients alternately with milk.  Fold in blueberries. Remember, fold gently, don't stir. Spoon batter into prepared cups.",

        "Bake in the preheated oven for 20 to 25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in center of a muffin comes out clean.  Cool in pans on wire rack.  These muffins freeze really well, and re-heat in the microwave successfully.  Hope you enjoy!!"
