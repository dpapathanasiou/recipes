        "Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (220 degrees C). Prick the eggplant several times with a fork, and remove the leaves. Place on a baking sheet. Bake for 30 minutes in the oven, turning over once, until tender. Remove from the oven, and slit open to cool.",
        "While the eggplant are still warm, remove the stem end and peel. Cut into chunks, and place them in the container of a blender or food processor. Process until smooth.",
        "In a small dish, combine the garlic, ginger, green onions, and red pepper flakes. In a separate dish, stir together the soy sauce, brown sugar, rice vinegar, and hot water.",
        "Heat a wok over high heat until hot enough to evaporate a drop of water. Pour in the peanut oil, and swirl to coat the wok. When the oil is hot, dump in the garlic mixture, and stir-fry for about 15 seconds. Pour in the soy sauce mixture, and bring to a simmer. Stir in the eggplant puree, cooking just until heated through. Remove to a serving dish, and stir in the sesame oil. Allow to cool, and serve at room temperature as a spread for the bread."
