        "Cream sugar with butter.  Add eggs and mix well.  Sift baking soda and all-purpose flour.  Add to the butter mixture.",
        "Shape dough into rolls, wrap in wax paper and chill at least several hours, preferable overnight.",
        "Slice as thinly as possible (very sharp, thin blade knife dipped in water works best). When roll starts to get soft, return to refrigerator and start on another roll.",
        "Decorate with colored sugar, etc. and bake in a preheated 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) oven until set but not brown, 8 - 10 minutes.  Yield depends on how thin the slices are but you should get at least 3 dozen.  NOTE:  This is one of those family recipes that was taught  to me with instructions like \"add flour til it looks right\" and \"bake it til it's done\".   I have tested these measurements but I've never been good at using a timer or paying attention to how many I've made!"
