        "Fry the balls 4 at a time until they turn light, golden brown, about 2 minutes. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate. Once the second batch of croquettes has been fried, return the first batch to the hot oil, and fry again until deep, golden brown and the croquettes are no longer opaque in the center, drain on paper towels while frying the second batch."
