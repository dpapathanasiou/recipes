        "Chop pumpkin and potatoes into smaller chunks and puree in a blender or food processor with some of the chicken broth until smooth.  Be sure to scrape the roasted spice paste off the baking dish and include it in the puree.  It may be necessary to deglaze the dish with a little chicken broth.",
        "Pour the pureed vegetables into the pot with the onions, and stir in as much additional chicken stock as needed to achieve the desired consistency.  Heat through."
