        "If cutlets are thick, lay them between 2 sheets of wax paper and pound to 1/2-inch thickness with flat side of a meat mallet or bottom of a small, heavy skillet. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Put 2 large (or 5 small) sage leaves on top of each cutlet, then wrap 2 slices of prosciutto crosswise around each cutlet, holding sage in place.",
        "Heat 1 1/2 tablespoons oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add 4 cutlets and cook until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer to a platter; tent with foil to keep warm. Repeat with remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons oil and remaining 4 cutlets.",
        "Add wine to skillet and simmer, scraping up any browned bits, 1 minute. Add broth and simmer until slightly reduced, 4 to 5 minutes. Remove from heat, add butter, and swirl skillet until butter has melted and sauce is creamy. Spoon 2 tablespoons sauce over each cutlet and serve."
