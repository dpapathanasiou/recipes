        "In a large skillet, cook sausage over medium heat. When sausage is half cooked through, drain off most of the fat. Add onion, red pepper, mushrooms and cilantro; cook until vegetables are tender and sausage is browned. Remove sausage and vegetables from pan, leaving a slight coating of oil.",
        "Whisk together 5 eggs, egg whites, 1/4 cup milk and cheese. Return skillet to medium-high heat and pour in egg mixture. Cook, stirring occasionally, until eggs are set. Remove from heat but keep warm.",
        "In a double boiler, over medium heat, combine egg yolks, butter and lemon juice.  Whisk continuously (watch the heat or it will curdle).  Remove from burner when butter has completely melted.",
        "In a mixing bowl, whisk together flour, egg and milk.  Pour mixture through a fine sieve to eliminate lumps. Heat a non-stick crepe pan on medium-high heat.  Spray with cooking spray and pour about 1/3 cup of batter in the pan.  Rotate the pan to spread a paper thin amount of batter around the pan.  Flip when it starts to bubble and cook until golden on both sides. Repeat until all batter is used.",
        "To assemble: Place one crepe on a plate, spoon eggs and sausage mixture down the middle of the crepe from top to bottom (like a taco) and fold over in a half circle.  Top with Hollandaise sauce and sprinkle with a little paprika.  Serve with a scoop of salsa on the side."
