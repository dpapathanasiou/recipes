        "Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Stir in the onion and ground lamb; cook and stir until the onion is tender, and the meat is no longer pink, about 7 minutes. Stir in the rice, salt, black pepper, and mint; cook 5 minutes longer. Add the water and parsley. Reduce the heat to medium-low, and continue cooking and stirring until the water has been completely absorbed by the rice, about 15 minutes. Stir the chicken broth and diced tomatoes together in an oven-proof dish that will just fit the peppers. Scoop the lamb mixture into the bell peppers, and place them into the dish.",
