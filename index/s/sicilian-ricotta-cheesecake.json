        "Bake in the center of the oven for about 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 hours, until a light golden color.  Make sure the center is fairly firm, and the point of a sharp knife inserted in the center comes out clean.  Cool on a wire rack.  It will sink slightly as it cools.  Cover, and chill till serving time."
