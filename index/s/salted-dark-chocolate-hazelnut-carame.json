        "Heat hazelnut spread in metal bowl over saucepan of gently simmering water and stir until hazelnut spread is warm, smooth, and easily stirred, about 5 minutes. Remove bowl from heat.",
        "Dissolve sugar in water in a small saucepan over medium heat. Brush sides of pan with a moistened pastry brush occasionally as sugar mixture cooks. Increase heat to medium-high and bring syrup to a boil and cook until syrup is a deep amber color, brushing down sides and swirling saucepan occasionally to prevent scorching, about 4 minutes.",
        "Pour cream into the syrup while stirring. Reduce heat to low and cook, stirring continually, until you have a smooth caramel, 5 to 10 minutes; gently stir into the melted hazelnut spread with 1/4 teaspoon sea salt.",
        "Refrigerate caramel mixture until firm, at least 3 hours.",
        "Spread cocoa powder into the bottom of a wide, shallow bowl.",
        "Scoop caramel mixture with a melon baller into 1 tablespoon portions; roll in the cocoa powder to coat; arrange onto a baking sheet.",
        "Cover truffle balls with plastic wrap and chill overnight or 8 hours.",
        "Line a 13x9x2-inch baking sheet with aluminum foil.",
        "Heat chopped chocolate in a metal bowl set over a saucepan of gently simmering water, stirring frequently until chocolate is melted and smooth and the chocolate reaches a temperature of 115 degrees F (46 degrees c). Remove bowl from over water.",
        "Working quickly, submerge each truffle ball in the melted chocolate. Lift truffles from chocolate with a fork and tap fork against side of bowl to remove excess coating. Transfer truffle to foil-lined pan to cool. Repeat with remaining truffle balls.",
        "Sprinkle finished truffles lightly with 1 tablespoon coarse sea salt before the chocolate hardens. Let stand until coating sets completely, at least 1 hour."
