        "Shape dough into 1 inch balls. Place on prepared sheets, spacing evenly. Bake about 20 minutes, or until firm and lightly colored.",
        "Sift 1/4 cup confectioners' sugar into a bowl. Transfer cookies to confectioners' sugar while still warm and roll gently to coat. Immediately transfer cookies to plastic bag and seal (this makes the cookies sweat and form an icing). Let stand 5 minutes in the bag. Transfer to rack and cool."
