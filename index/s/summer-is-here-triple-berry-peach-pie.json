        "Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a 9 inch pie plate with half of the dough and brush with half of the beaten egg white.",
        "Combine the sliced peaches, strawberries, blueberries, and raspberries in a large bowl; set aside. Mix the flour, cornstarch, brown sugar, 1/2 cup white sugar, 2 teaspoons cinnamon, and nutmeg together. Gently fold the flour mixture into the fruit, taking care not to crush the berries. Transfer the fruit mixture into the pastry-lined pie plate. The filling will be piled high but will cook down. Dot with butter.",
        "Top the filled pie with a lattice crust or a full top crust (cut decorative slits in the crust to allow steam to escape). Brush the top crust or lattice with the remaining egg white. Combine 1 teaspoon cinnamon and 1 tablespoon sugar and sprinkle the mixture on the crust. Place the pie on a baking sheet to catch drips.",
        "Bake the pie until the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbly, 45 to 60 minutes. Turn off the oven and let the pie set for 30 minutes; transfer to a cooling rack. The filling will be loose if served warm, but will tighten up when the pie is completely cooled."
