        "Set-up grill for indirect cooking and place smoker box in gas grill if using. If using a charcoal grill, pour beer into a drip pan and place the drip pan on the charcoal grate between the two piles of charcoal. If using a gas grill, pour the beer into a small drip pan and put on the far-left corner of the cooking grates. (The beer is in the pan to add moisture to the cooking environment while the meat smokes. This is a good idea anytime you smoke-cook foods for a long period of time because smoke reduces the moisture in the air.)",
        "Place wood chips that have been soaked in water for 30 minutes directly on the gray-ashed charcoal, if using a charcoal grill, or in the smoker box if using a gas grill.",
        "Place brisket (fat side up) in center of the cooking grate over the drip pan. You will not turn the brisket during the cooking time at all. Grill 5 to 7 hours or until meat thermometer registers 180\u00b0F. When done, remove brisket from grill and let rest 20 minutes. Slice thin and serve immediately with pickled okra and sliced white bread."
