        "Whisk together the soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, cranberry-grape juice, teriyaki sauce, hot sauce, steak sauce, brown sugar, and black pepper in a bowl, and pour into a resealable plastic bag. Add the flank steak, coat with the marinade, squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator for 8 to 10 hours.",
        "Remove the flank steak from the marinade and wipe off the excess. Place the flank steak onto the wire racks of the smoker. It is ok if the meat is touching, but to not stack.",
        "Place the racks into a smoker, and smoke according to manufacturer's directions, using 4 pans of wood chips (1 pan per hour) until the jerky has dried and will break when bent, 6 to 8 hours."
