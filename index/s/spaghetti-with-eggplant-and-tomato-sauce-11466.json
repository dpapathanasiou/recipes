        "While the sauce is simmering, cut the eggplant into 1/2-inch dice, divide it between 2-jelly-roll pans, and drizzle it with the remaining 4 tablespoons oil. Bake the eggplant on the upper and lower racks of a preheated 400\u00b0.F. oven for 10 minutes, stir it and switch the pan positions in the oven. Bake the eggplant for 10 minutes more, or until it is very tender and golden, and stir it into the sauce with salt and pepper to taste.",
