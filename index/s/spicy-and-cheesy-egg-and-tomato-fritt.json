        "Whisk the egg whites, eggs, and 1/2 cup of the Cheddar cheese together in a bowl. Cook the egg mixture in the hot skillet until the bottom of the eggs turn opaque, about 1 minute. Cover the skillet with a lid and cook until the eggs are nearly set, 4 to 5 minutes more. Spread the diced tomatoes with chiles and the remaining cheese over the eggs.",
        "Move the skillet to the oven and cook under the broiler until the eggs finish setting and the cheese is completely melted, 2 to 3 minutes. Allow the frittata to rest 5 minutes before slicing to serve."
