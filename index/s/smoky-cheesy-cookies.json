        "Combine butter, Gouda cheese, Cheddar cheese, sea salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper in a food processor; pulse until butter is in bits and the mixture forms small curds. Add flour; pulse until dough looks moist and forms large popcorn-sized curds.",
        "Turn dough out onto a flat surface; knead gently just until it comes together and you can shape it into a ball. Divide into 2 pieces. Pat each piece into a disk.",
        "Place 1 disk between 2 sheets of parchment paper. Roll to a thickness of 1/4 inch. Repeat with second disk. Stack sheets of dough on a baking sheet. Freeze until firm, about 1 hour.",

        "Bake cookies in the preheated oven until lightly golden on the bottom, about 9 minutes. Rotate baking sheet. Continue baking until bottoms are golden brown and tops are lightly golden, about 5 minutes more. Cool on the baking sheet for 2 minutes. Transfer to a rack to cool completely, about 10 minutes.",
        "Gather dough scraps, roll to a thickness of 1/4-inch, and freeze until firm, about 15 minutes. Cut into cookies and bake."
