        "Dissolve yeast in warm water and let stand until creamy, about ten minutes. In a large bowl, combine the cake mix and flour. Slowly add the yeast and water mixture and stir until smooth. Cover the bowl and let dough rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.",
        "Grease a 10x15 inch baking pan with high sides, or two 9x13 inch pans. With a spatula, scoop the dough out onto a heavily floured surface. Dust the top and roll or pat the dough into a large rectangle, about 12x24 inches. Brush dough with the melted butter or margarine. Combine sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl and sprinkle over the dough. Roll up dough jelly roll fashion and seal edge with a little water. Cut the roll into 1 1/2 to 2 inch slices. Place snugly into the prepared pan. Let rise in a warm place for about 1/2 hour or until doubled.",
        "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C)",
        "While rolls are rising, combine butter or margarine, corn syrup and brown sugar in a heavy saucepan. Cook over low heat, stirring occasionally, until smooth. Remove from heat.  When rolls have risen, pour the syrup over the tops of the rolls, letting it dribble down into the pan. Sprinkle rolls with pecans and bake at 350 degrees F (175 degree C) for 25 minutes or until golden brown."
