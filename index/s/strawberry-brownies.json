        "Whisk together egg, melted butter, and vanilla in a large bowl.  Puree about 1/4 cup of the sliced strawberries and whisk into the butter.  Sift together the sugar, cocoa powder, and cake flour.  Fold into the butter, and mix until well incorporated.  Use more flour if needed to end up with a mixture in between a cake batter and a cookie dough (the strawberries will add additional moisture).  Gently fold in the remaining sliced strawberries and pour the batter into prepared pie plate.",
