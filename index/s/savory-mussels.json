        "Pour the chicken broth into the pot and bring to a boil; cook at a boil for 5 minutes. Add the mussels; cover the pot and allow the mussels to simmer in the broth mixture just until they begin to open, about 5 minutes. Discard any mussels which do not open. Stir the spinach into the broth just before serving hot."
