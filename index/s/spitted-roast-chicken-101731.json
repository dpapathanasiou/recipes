        "Put a good square of butter and a little salt and pepper in the cavity of each chicken. Truss well and brush them with melted butter or oil seasoned to taste with salt, pepper and paprika. Spit them carefully. Run the spit through the backbone just above the tail and guide it to the top part of the breast at the base of the neck. This way you achieve a good balance.",
        "When your fire has burned down to a good bed of coals, make a ring of the briquets or charcoal leaving the center area directly under the chickens clear to catch the drippings. Arrange the spitted chickens over this space and roast, basting them frequently with equal parts of melted butter and white wine or dry vermouth. The cooking time will take from 45 minutes to 1 1/4 hours, depending on the size of the birds.",
        "Plain roast chicken goes best with crisp saut\u00e9ed potatoes and a fresh green salad with a minimum of dressing. As for wine, most people prefer a white, such as a Pinot Blanc from California, or a Meursault or Pouilly Fuiss\u00e9 from France."
