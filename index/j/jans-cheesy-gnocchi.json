        "Place cottage cheese in a mesh strainer over a bowl. Let drain for 2 hours, stirring occasionally, pressing any liquid out. You should be able to express 1/2 cup of liquid. Discard liquid.",
        "Mix drained cottage cheese, eggs, non-dairy Parmesan cheese substitute, salt, pepper, garlic powder and flour together in a bowl. Stir until mixture is well combined and forms a very soft, sticky dough.",
        "Scrape cheese into a ball and lightly dust with flour. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 hour.",
        "Divide the dough into 4 pieces. On a lightly floured surface, roll each piece into a 1/2-inch thick rope. Cut each rope into 1-inch pieces, and place on a lightly floured baking sheet. Roll the gnocchi down the tines of a fork or a gnocchi board to create ridges and return them to the floured baking sheet. Refrigerate until ready to use.",
        "Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the gnocchi and gently stir the pot. Cook the gnocchi until they float to the top surface of the water, about 2 minutes. Drain well and serve with your favorite sauce."
