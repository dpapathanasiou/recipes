Beat in  the eggs, one at a time, allowing each egg to blend into the cream cheese mixture before adding the next. Beat the flour, vanilla extract, and lime juice into the cream cheese mixture with the last egg. Fold the jalapeno pepper into the mixture; mixing just enough to evenly combine. Pour into the prepared crust.",

Remove from the oven, run the tip of a paring knife around the edges of the pan, set the pan on a wire rack, and allow the cheesecake to cool at room temperature for 1 hour before placing into the refrigerator, and cooling 4 hours to overnight."
