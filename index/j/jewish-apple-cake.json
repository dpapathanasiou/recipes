        "Mix apples, 5 tablespoons sugar, and 2 tablespoons ground cinnamon in a bowl and set aside. Beat the oil and 2 cups of sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl. Add the room-temperature eggs one at a time, allowing each egg to blend into the sugar mixture before adding the next. Beat in the vanilla and 1/4 cup of orange juice with the last egg.  Combine the flour, baking powder, and salt in a small bowl and stir into the sugar mixture; mixing until just incorporated.  Pour half of the batter into the prepared tube pan. Layer the apple mixture on top, then pour the remaining batter over the apples.",
