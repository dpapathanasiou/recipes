        "Place diced lamb in a bowl, toss with 2 tablespoons of the olive oil, and set aside.  In a large resealable bag, toss together the paprika, turmeric, cumin, cayenne, cinnamon, cloves, cardamom, salt, ginger, saffron, garlic powder, and coriander; mix well.  Add the lamb to the bag, and toss around to coat well.  Refrigerate at least 8 hours, preferably overnight.",
        "Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a large, heavy bottomed pot over medium-high heat.  Add 1/3 of the lamb, and brown well.  Remove to a plate, and repeat with remaining lamb.  Add onions and carrots to the pot and cook for 5 minutes.  Stir in the fresh garlic and ginger; continue cooking for an additional 5 minutes.  Return the lamb to the pot and stir in the lemon zest, chicken broth, tomato paste, and honey.  Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 1 1/2 to 2 hours, stirring occasionally, until the meat is tender.",
