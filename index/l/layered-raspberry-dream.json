        "Beat cream cheese, confectioners' sugar, and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract together in a bowl until soft and fluffy. Spread cream cheese mixture over graham cracker crust and chill until firm, about 30 more minutes.",
        "Whisk raspberry gelatin and boiling water together in a separate large bowl until gelatin has dissolved; stir in lemon juice. Gently fold frozen raspberries into warm gelatin; cold raspberries will cause gelatin to begin to set. Spread raspberry mixture over cream cheese layer in pan.",
