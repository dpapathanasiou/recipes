        "Place loquats into a saucepan and stir in water, orange juice, and brown sugar until sugar has dissolved. Bring the mixture to a boil and stir in ground ginger, cinnamon, lemon pepper, and smoked paprika. Reduce heat to low and simmer until loquats are soft and starting to break apart, about 20 minutes, occasionally whisking vigorously to help break up the fruit. When sauce is thick, stir in vinegar and simmer 3 more minutes. Remove from heat.",
        "Heat grapeseed oil in a skillet over medium heat and pan-fry chicken breasts until golden brown and no longer pink in the center, 5 to 8 minutes per side. Remove chicken breasts and cut into bite-size pieces, return to skillet, and stir in 1/4 the loquat sauce, scraping and dissolving any browned bits of food into the sauce. Serve with remaining loquat sauce on the side."
