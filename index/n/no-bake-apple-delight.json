        "Cover graham crackers with LUCKY LEAF(R)Premium Apple Pie Filling. Then spoon 1/3 of the cream cheese filling on top of the apple filling. Add a small handful of toffee chips on top and cover with a thin layer of whipped topping. Repeat this twice so that you end up with three layers. Cover the top layer of whipped topping with additional toffee bites and then drizzle with caramel.",
