        "Heat sugar mixture in the microwave oven on High for 5 minutes; stir well. Remove plastic and continue to cook in the microwave until the chocolate mixture reaches soft-ball stage, about 235 degrees (113 degrees F), 4 to 7 minutes. Stir again thoroughly and continue cooking on High for 6 to 7 minutes. Lie butter atop the chocolate mixture and set aside to let it melt as the chocolate mixture cools.",

        "Let fudge sit until set, 30 to 40 minutes. Cut while still slightly warm."
