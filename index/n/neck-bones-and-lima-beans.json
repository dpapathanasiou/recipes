        "Combine the garlic powder, onion powder, cayenne pepper, sage, nutmeg, seasoned salt, salt, and pepper in a small bowl. Rub 3/4 of this mixture into the pork neck bones; set the neck bones and remaining seasoning aside.",
        "Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir in the onion and bell pepper; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the neck bones; reduce heat to low, and cover. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 1 hour, adding water as needed to keep the meat and vegetables from scorching.",
        "Meanwhile, place the lima beans into a large pot and pour in 8 cups of water; bring to a boil over high heat. Once boiling, turn off the heat, cover, and let stand 1 hour.",
        "After the beans have stood for 1 hour, drain and rinse. Return the beans to the pot, and pour in 2 cups of water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then stir in the pork and vegetables, and the remaining spice mixture. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer until the lima beans are tender, and the pork is falling off the bones, about 30 minutes."
