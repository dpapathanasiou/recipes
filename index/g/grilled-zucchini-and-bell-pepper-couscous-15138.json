        "Trim zucchini and cut each lengthwise into 1/4-inch-thick slices. Quarter bell pepper lengthwise, discarding seeds, stem, and ribs. Brush zucchini with oil and grill with bell pepper on a lightly oiled rack set 5 to 6 inches over glowing coals until zucchini is just tender and pepper is crisp-tender, about 5 minutes on each side. (Alternatively, vegetables may be grilled in a hot well-seasoned ridged grill pan over moderately high heat.) Cut zucchini into 1-inch-wide pieces and cut bell pepper into 1/4-inch-wide strips.",
        "Mince garlic and mash to a paste with salt. In a dry 1 1/2-quart heavy saucepan toast cumin seeds over moderately low heat, swirling pan occasionally, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add broth and water and bring to a boil. Add couscous and immediately cover pan. Remove pan from heat and let couscous stand 5 minutes. With a fork fluff couscous and in a bowl toss with vegetables, garlic paste, and salt to taste."
