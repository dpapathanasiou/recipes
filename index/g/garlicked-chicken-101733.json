        "Melt the garlic butter, add the lemon juice and salt and pepper. Roast the chicken on a spit, basting it frequently with the melted butter mixture.",
        "Serve this highly flavored fowl with noodles dressed with butter and cheese, celery sticks and toasted herbed bread. Split a loaf of French bread and spread it with butter to which you have added parsley, chives and rosemary. Toast until heated through and crisp. Choose a robust Chianti to drink with this garlicky chicken."
