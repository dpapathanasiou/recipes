Light a large chimney starter of charcoal (80 to 100 briquettes) and pour lit charcoal onto bottom rack, leaving about one quarter of bottom rack free of charcoal and banking remaining coals across rest of bottom rack so that coals are about 3 times higher on opposite side. Charcoal fire is medium-hot when you can hold your hand 5 inches above thickest layer of coals for 3 to 4 seconds. 3Sear steak on lightly oiled grill rack over thickest layer of coals, uncovered, 1 minute on each side, then move steak to area over fewer coals and grill, uncovered, turning occasionally and moving to coolest area of grill if browning too quickly, until thermometer inserted horizontally 2 inches into meat registers 120\u00b0F, 10 to 12 minutes. Transfer to a plate and let stand 10 minutes (steak will continue to cook, reaching medium-rare).",

Transfer to a plate and let stand 10 minutes (steak will continue to cook, reaching medium-rare).",
        "While steak is standing, grill onions (covered only if using a gas grill) over moderate heat, turning over once, until tender, about 6 minutes.",
