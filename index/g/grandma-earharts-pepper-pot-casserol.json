Mix in the pork sausage, and cook until the meat is browned, breaking it up into crumbles as it cooks, about 8 more minutes. Drain off excess grease.

Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 5 minutes. Drain well in a colander set in the sink.
