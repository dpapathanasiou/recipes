        "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line two cookie sheets with parchment paper, or you may use ungreased cookie sheets.",
        "In a medium bowl, cream together the shortening and sugar until smooth. Beat in the egg and molasses. Combine the flour, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, ginger and cloves; stir into the batter until it forms a dough. The dough may seem a bit crumbly, but that is ok. Keep mixing and it will come together.",
        "Remove dough from the bowl, and knead for a few turns. Pat out into a square, and divide into 6 equal pieces. Roll each piece out into a 12 inch long log. Place 3 logs onto each cookie sheet. Wet the tops of the logs with a little bit of water using your fingertips, then sprinkle with sugar.",
        "Bake for 10 to 12 minutes in the preheated oven. Allow the cookies to cool for a couple of minutes, then slice the bars diagonally into 1 inch pieces using a knife or pizza cutter. Remove from cookie sheets to cool on wire racks. When completely cool, store in an airtight container at room temperature."
