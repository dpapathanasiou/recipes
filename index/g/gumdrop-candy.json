        "Once the gelatin has set, coat the top surface with white sugar. Turn the pan over, and tap the gel out onto a clean surface that has been dusted with sugar. Cut into 1 inch squares, and roll in sugar. Candy will be very sticky. Let the sugared squares set out to dry for at least a couple of hours before storing."
