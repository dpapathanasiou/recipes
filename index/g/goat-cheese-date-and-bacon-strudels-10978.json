        "Preheat the oven to 400\u00b0F. On a work surface arrange a 20-inch-long sheet of wax paper with a long side facing you. Put 1 sheet of the phyllo on the wax paper, brush it with some of the butter, and sprinkle it with about 2 teaspoons of the sesame seeds. On this, layer, brush, and sprinkle 1 more sheet of the phyllo in the same manner and lay a third sheet of phyllo on top. Spread 1/2 cup of the goat cheese along the pastry in a 1-inch strip about 2 inches above the near long side, leaving a 2-inch border at each end. Arrange half the date pieces on the cheese and sprinkle them with half the bacon, half the scallion, and 2 teaspoons of the remaining sesame seeds. Using the wax paper as a guide, lift the bottom 2 inches of the pastry over the filling, fold in the ends, and roll up the strudel tightly. Transfer the strudel carefully, seam side down, to a lightly buttered baking sheet and brush it with some of the remaining butter. Make another strudel with the remaining ingredients in the same manner.",
        "Bake the 2 strudels in the lower third of the oven for 15 to 20 minutes, or until they are golden, and let them cool to warm on the baking sheet on a rack. The strudels may be made 1 day in advance and kept covered loosely and chilled. Reheat the strudels in a preheated 357\u00b0F. oven for 10 minutes. Serve the strudels warm, cut into 1-inch pieces with a serrated knife."
