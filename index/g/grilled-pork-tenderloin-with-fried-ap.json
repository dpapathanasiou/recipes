        "Cook pork on the preheated grill, turning twice on each side, until no longer pink in the center, 6 to 7 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Remove pork from grill and cover with aluminum foil; let rest for 5 minutes. Slice pork and place on a serving platter.",
