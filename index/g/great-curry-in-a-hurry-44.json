        "Melt butter in heavy medium skillet over medium-high heat. Season chicken with salt and pepper and saut\u00e9 until just cooked through, about 5 minutes per side. Transfer chicken to plate. Pour off all but 1 tablespoon drippings. Add curry powder to skillet and stir until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add brandy and cook until almost evaporated, standing back in case brandy ignites. Mix in flour. Add broth, cream and chutney and stir until smooth. Increase heat and boil 2 minutes, stirring constantly, until sauce coats spoon lightly. Return chicken and any collected juices to skillet. Cook just until chicken is heated through, about 2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste."
