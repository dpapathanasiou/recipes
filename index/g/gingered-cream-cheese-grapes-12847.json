        "In a bowl cream together the cream cheese and the ginger. Put 1 teaspoon of the mixture in the palm of one hand and roll it around a grape, using both palms to coat the grape completely. Coat the remaining grapes in the same manner and on a wax-paper-lined tray chill them for 15 minutes. Roll the cheese-coated grapes in the pecans coating them completely, and chill them until the coating is firm."
