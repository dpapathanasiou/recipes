        "In a large bowl, beat the egg yolks and sugar until frothy.  Gradually pour the warm milk into the egg yolks, whisking constantly.  Return mixture to saucepan; cook over medium heat, stirring with a wooden spoon until the mixture gels slightly and coats the back of the spoon. If small egg lumps begin to show, remove from heat immediately.",
        "Pour the mixture through a sieve or fine strainer into a bowl. Cover, and chill for several hours or overnight.",
