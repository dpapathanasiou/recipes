        "In a large bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs one at a time.  Beat in the flour alternately with the milk, mixing just until incorporated.",
        "Pour batter evenly into prepared loaf pans. Bake in the preheated oven for 70 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cakes comes out clean.  After removing them from the oven, immediately loosen cake edges with a knife.  Allow to cool in pans for 10 minutes, then remove from the pans.  Strip off the parchment paper and cool completely on wire racks."
