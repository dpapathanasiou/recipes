    "directions": [
        "Remove the large leaves from the mint (about 30 leaves). If desired, reserve 10 sprigs for garnish; reserve the remaining mint for another use.",
        "Preheat the oven to 200\u00b0F (or to warm, depending on the oven). Line two large baking sheets with parchment paper.",
        "In a shallow bowl, gently whisk the egg whites. Spread the sugar in another shallow bowl. Dip the mint leaves one at a time in the egg whites, shaking off the excess, then dip in the sugar, turning to coat well on both sides, and place on the baking sheets in a single layer.",
        "Bake the leaves until thoroughly dry and crisp (2-1/2 hours should be enough). Let cool completely on the baking sheets on wire racks, then transfer to an airtight container until ready to use.",
        "Coarsely chop the candied mint; set aside. (You should have about 3/4 cup.)",
        "Lightly grease a 9 1/4 x 5 1/4 x 2 3/4-inch metal loaf pan (using a pan of these exact dimensions is not critical, as long as you approximate the dimensions). Line the pan with plastic wrap so that the plastic extends about 1 inch beyond the rim of the pan.",
        "Place the chopped chocolate in a small bowl. In a small saucepan, bring 1/2 cup of the cream to a gentle boil over medium heat. Pour the hot cream over the chocolate and let stand for 30 seconds to melt the chocolate, then whisk gently until smooth. Transfer the ganache to a large bowl and set aside.",
        "In a chilled large bowl, using a hand-held electric mixer set at medium speed, whip the remaining 1 1/3 cups cream until soft peaks form. Cover and refrigerate.",
        "In a small heavy saucepan, combine the sugar and water and bring to a boil over medium-low heat, stirring constantly until the sugar dissovles. Using a clean pastry brush dipped in warm water, wash down the side of the pan to remove any sugar crystals. Raise the heat to medium-high and boil the syrup for 8 to 10 minutes, or until it registers 249\u00b0 F on a candy thermometer. Meanwhile, when the syrup reaches 235\u00b0 F, start preparing the egg yolks.",
        "In the 4 1/4-quart bowl of a heavy-duty mixer, using the wire whip attachment, beat the egg yolks for about 5 minutes, until thick, pale, and almost tripled in volume.",
        "When the syrup registers 249\u00b0 F, immediately remove it from the heat. While beating the egg yolks at medium speed, gradually pour the syrup in a slow, steady stream near the side of the bowl onto the yolks. Continue beating for 5-8 minutes, until the mixture is completely cool. If necessary, using a wire whisk, whisk the whip cream until, soft peaks form again. Using a large rubber spatula, fold a few tablespoons of the whipped cream into the ganache. Gradually fold in the remaining whipped cream, then gently fold in the cooled egg yolk mixture. Fold in the chopped candied mint. Scrape the parfait mixture into the prepared pan and smooth the top. Wrap the pan in plastic wrap and aluminum foil and freeze overnight. ( The parfait can be prepared up to 2 days ahead.)",
        "Combine the cocoa powder and chopped chocolate in a small bowl. Set aside.",
        "In a small heavy saucepan, combine the sugar and water and bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring constantly until the sugar dissolves. Pour the syrup over the cocoa, mixture and let stand for 30 seconds to melt the chocolate, then whisk gently until smooth. Strain the sauce through a fine strainer into a bowl and let cool. Cover and refrigerate until ready to serve. (The sauce can be made up to a day ahead; whisk gently until completely smooth before serving.)",
        "Cover a 9 1/2 x 5-inch cardboard rectangle with aluminum foil. Remove the parfait from the freezer and unwrap the pan. Place the foil-covered rectangle on top of the loaf pan, invert the pan onto the cardboard and lift off the pan. (If necessary, reinvert the pan and tug gently on the overhanging plastic wrap to release the parfait from the pan, then invert onto the cardboard again.) If the parfait does not seem to be budging, take a sponge with hot water and run it along all sides of the pan. Place the still-wrapped parfait in the freezer until ready to serve.",
        "To serve, spoon or drizzle some of the sauce onto each plate. With a very sharp thin-bladed knife, cut the parfait into 10 slices, wiping the blade clean between each slice. Garnish each plate with a small mint sprig if desired, and serve immediately."
