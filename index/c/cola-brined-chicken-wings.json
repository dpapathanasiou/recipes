        "Pour 1/2 cup kosher salt and the cola into a resealable plastic bag, mix until the salt dissolves. Add the chicken wings, coat with the brine, squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag. Brine in the refrigerator for 2 hours. While the chicken is brining, stir together the vegetable oil, brown sugar, 2 tablespoons kosher salt, garlic powder, black pepper, mustard powder, and paprika in a small bowl to form a paste; set aside.",
