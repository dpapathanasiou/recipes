        "In Udine the chicken were free-range, small and scrawny. To make this dish you need poussins, or very small chickens. Cut four 1 1/2-pound chickens in two. Rub the chicken with garlic cloves and then with 2 tablespoons lime juice. Sprinkle the chickens with salt and pepper. Mix 2 tablespoons oregano with 2 tablespoons thyme. Rub the chicken with the herbs and refrigerate for at least 1 hour. Just before broiling, rub the chickens with 2 tablespoons olive oil. Broil the chickens on one side for 8 minutes, turn them, and broil them for another 8 minutes. The broiling time depends on how large the chickens are. Serve the chickens with a salad of watercress."
