        "Spoon 1/3 of the cake batter into the prepared pan; layer the Irish cream filling on top. Spoon remaining cake batter over the filling.",
        "Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the cake comes out clean, 40 to 50 minutes.",
        "Loosen the edges of the cake from the pan with a thin spatula; let cake rest in pan 15 minutes. Invert pan over a wire rack to release cake and allow to cool completely on the rack.",
