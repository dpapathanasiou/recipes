        "Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F.",
        "Whisk together all ingredients except chocolate until combined well. Working in batches of 4, drop 1 level teaspoon of batter for each cookie about 3 inches apart onto nonstick-pad-lined or buttered baking sheet, then spread each dollop of batter into a 3-inch round with offset spatula or back of a spoon.",
        "Bake cookies 1 sheet at a time in middle of oven until edges are golden, 6 to 8 minutes. Working quickly, lift 1 cookie off sheet with a long flexible spatula, then roll it around pencil or chopstick to form a narrow cylinder. Immediately slide \"cigarette\" off chopstick or pencil and transfer to a rack to cool. Make more \"cigarettes\" in same manner. (If cookies become too brittle to roll, return to oven for 1 minute to soften.)",
        "Melt chocolate in a double boiler or a metal bowl set over a saucepan of barely simmering water, stirring occasionally, then remove top of double boiler or bowl from heat.",
        "When cookies are cool, working with 1 cookie at a time, dip 1/4 inch of tip of 1 end into melted chocolate (\"ash\"), letting excess drip off, and place on a parchment- or wax-paper-lined baking sheet. Let stand at room temperature until chocolate sets."
