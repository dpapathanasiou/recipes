        "In a large bowl, cream together the butter, 1 1/3 cups sugar, and chai tea mix until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each. Combine the flour, baking powder, and salt; blend into the creamed mixture until all of the dry has been absorbed. Cover the dough, and refrigerate for 1 hour.",
        "Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Roll the cookie dough into walnut sized balls, and roll the balls in sugar. Place the cookies onto greased cookie sheets about 3 inches apart, and flatten slightly using the tines of a fork.",
        "Bake for 10 to 12 minutes in the preheated oven, just until the edges begin to brown. Remove from cookie sheets to cool on wire racks."
