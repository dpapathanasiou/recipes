        "Place the chicken thighs, water, and 1 bouillon cube into a large saucepan, and bring to a boil over medium heat. Reduce heat to a simmer, and cook the chicken thighs until very tender, about 1 hour. Remove the chicken thighs from the pan, and skim fat from the stock; there should be about 4 1/2 cups of liquid. Separate the chicken meat from bones and skin, and chop the meat. Discard the bones and skin.",
        "Return the chicken meat to the stock. Mix in onion, red and orange bell pepper, turkey kielbasa, rice, Italian seasoning, red pepper flakes, garlic salt, and 2 more chicken bouillon cubes. Bring the mixture to a simmer, cover the pot, and simmer on low heat until the rice is cooked through and tender, about 20 minutes. Stir after 10 minutes and again after 15 minutes. Remove from heat, and mix in the cream of mushroom soup until thoroughly combined. Serve hot."
