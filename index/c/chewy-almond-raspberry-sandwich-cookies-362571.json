        "Position 1 rack in top third and 1 rack in bottom third of oven; preheat to 350\u00b0F. Line 2 large baking sheets with parchment. Place almonds in center of third (unlined) rimmed baking sheet, forming 1/4-inch-thick layer.",
        "Finely grind almond paste, 1 cup sugar, and cinnamon in processor. Add egg whites; process until well blended. Transfer dough to large resealable plastic bag. Press dough down into 1 corner of bag. Using scissors, snip off corner, leaving 1/2-inch opening. Working in batches, squeeze dough from bag in 2 1/2-inch-long strips atop almonds on sheet. Sprinkle some of loose almonds on sheet over strips; carefully roll strips in almonds to coat lightly (dough will be soft and sticky). Transfer cookies to prepared baking sheets, spacing apart.",
        "Bake cookies until light golden brown, reversing position of sheets halfway through baking, about 12 minutes. Let cookies stand on sheets 5 minutes; transfer to rack. Sift powdered sugar over cookies.",
