        "Whisk egg with 3 tablespoons melted butter, vanilla extract, and 1 tablespoon white sugar in a bowl until thoroughly combined; whisk in milk and cream. Sift flour with baking powder and salt in a separate bowl; stir flour mixture into liquid ingredients to make a smooth batter.",
        "Stir 1/4 cup white sugar with brown sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl.",
        "Melt 1 teaspoon butter in a skillet over medium-low heat. Scoop up about 3 tablespoons of batter and pour into skillet. Sprinkle top of pancake with about 2 teaspoons of cinnamon sugar in an even layer; cook pancake until bottom is golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip pancake over onto sugared side and cook until the cinnamon sugar melts into a crust, about 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter and cinnamon sugar. Let pancakes cool without stacking to avoid softening the sugar crust."
