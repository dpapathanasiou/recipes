        "Dissolve the yeast in warm water in a large mixing bowl. Let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes. Lightly grease the inside of another large mixing bowl, and set aside.",
        "Meanwhile, heat the milk and 1/2 cup butter in a pan over medium heat. Stir in 1/2 cup white sugar and salt. Remove from heat, and cool to room temperature. Stir the milk mixture into the yeast mixture until blended. Mix in the eggs, and gradually stir in the flour, 1 cup at a time, to make a soft dough. Turn the dough out onto a clean, lightly floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes. Place the dough into the greased bowl, turning to coat the surface. Cover with a damp cloth, and set in a warm place until dough doubles in size, 1 to 2 hours.",
        "Lightly grease a 9 inch tube pan with a solid bottom. Make the syrup by mixing 1/3 cup butter, brown sugar, and corn syrup in a small pan over medium heat. Stir until the butter melts and sugar dissolves. Pour evenly into the bottom of the prepared tube pan.",
        "Punch down the dough, and turn out onto a lightly floured surface. Cover with a clean cloth, and let rise 10 minutes.",
        "Meanwhile, make the topping by mixing 3/4 cup white sugar with the cinnamon in a shallow bowl. Pour 1/4 cup melted butter into a second bowl.",
        "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).",
        "Divide the dough into 1 inch balls. Roll each ball first in the melted butter, then in the cinnamon-sugar mixture. Arrange balls side by side around the bottom of the  tube pan. Cover with a cloth, and set in a warm place until the dough doubles in size, about 1 hour. Drizzle1 tablespoon heavy cream over each ball.",
        "Bake until tops are golden brown, 45 to 55 minutes. Remove pan from oven and immediately invert onto a large serving plate."
