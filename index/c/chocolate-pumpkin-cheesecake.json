        "Beat cream cheese in a large bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy, scraping sides frequently to ensure evenness and no lumps.  Beat in 1 1/2 cup sugar, vanilla extract, and maple extract; add pumpkin puree and beat to combine. Add eggs, one at a time, mixing until incorporated and scraping the bowl each time. Add cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, and salt; beat once more until well distributed.",

        "Bake in preheated oven until edges are puffed and surface of cheesecake is firm except for a small spot in the center that will jiggle when the pan is gently shaken, about 55 minutes. Turn off heat and allow the cheesecake to cool to room temperature in the oven with the door open, about 1 hour. Refrigerate until completely chilled, about 2 hours."
