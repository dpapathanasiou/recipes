Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter. Transfer pancakes to a wire rack to cool.",

Top with a final pancake and garnish with 1/4 of the shredded carrot and 1/4 of the toasted pecans. Repeat with remaining pancakes, frosting, carrots, and pecans to create 3 more cakes."
