Cut each circle into 10 wedges. Brush melted margarine onto the circles. Roll up the wedges, beginning at the wide end. Place on prepared baking sheets with the end of the roll on the bottom. Brush the rolls with margarine and beaten egg white. Sprinkle with poppy seeds. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 25 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).",
