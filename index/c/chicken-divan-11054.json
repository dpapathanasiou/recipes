        "In a large saucepan of boiling salted water cook the broccoli for 6 to 8 minutes, or until it is just tender, drain it well, and keep it warm. In a heavy saucepan melt the butter over moderately low heat, add the flour, and cook the roux, stirring, for 3 minutes. Add the broth, stirring, bring the mixture to a boil, stirring, and simmer it, stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes. Reduce the heat to low and cook the mixture, stirring, for 10 minutes. In a bowl beat the cream until it holds stiff peaks, fold it, the Sherry, and the lemon juice into the sauce, and season the sauce with salt and pepper.",
        "Arrange the broccoli on a flameproof platter or in a 2-quart gratin dish and pour half the sauce over it. Stir 1/4 cup of the Parmesan into the remaining sauce. Arrange the chicken on the broccoli, pour the remaining sauce over it, and sprinkle the mixture with the remaining 1/4 cup Parmesan. Broil the mixture under a preheated broiler about 6 inches from the heat for 1 minute, or until the sauce is golden and bubbling."
