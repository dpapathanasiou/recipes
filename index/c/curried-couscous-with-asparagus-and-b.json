        "Bring 1 3/4 cups water to a boil in a saucepan. Slowly pour couscous and raisins into the boiling water while stirring. Place a cover on the saucepan, reduce heat to low, and simmer until the couscous absorbs most of the water, 8 to 10 minutes.",
        "Remove saucepan from heat and set aside until couscous absorbs remaining water, about 5 minutes more. Fluff couscous with a fork.",
        "Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Saute asparagus, green onions, and carrots in hot oil until tender-crisp, about 5 minutes.",
        "Mix vinegar, sugar, curry powder, ginger, and salt together in a large bowl until the sugar is completely dissolved into the vinegar; add the couscous mixture, asparagus mixture, blue cheese, and sunflower kernels. Gently fold the mixture until the kernels are evenly distributed through the mixture."
