Remove pepper and onion from the skillet and set aside. Add the chicken to the skillet; season with jerk seasoning; cook and stir chicken until no longer pink inside. Pour the plum sauce in with the chicken; add the bell peppers and onions; toss to combine. Cook until the peppers and onions are heated completely, 3 to 5 minutes.
