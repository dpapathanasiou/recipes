        "In a large saucepan combine the chicken with enough water to cover it by 1 inch, bring the water to a boil, and simmer the chicken for 20 minutes, or until it is cooked through. While the chicken is cooking, in a skillet cook the onion in the oil over moderate heat, stirring, until it is pale golden and add the tomato juice, the chutney, the curry powder, the vinegar, and salt and pepper to taste. Simmer the sauce, stirring, for 1 minute and transfer it to a bowl. Transfer the chicken to a cutting board and let it cool. Discard the skin and bones from the chicken, cut the meat into 1/2-inch pieces, and stir it into the sauce. Add the yogurt, toss the salad well, and sprinkle it with the almonds."
