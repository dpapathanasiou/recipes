        "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line bottom and sides of an 11x7-inch glass baking pan with parchment paper; leave paper hanging over pan edges so that cookies can be lifted out after baking.",
        "Beat butter and brown sugar together with an electric mixer until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Stir flour into butter mixture until crumbly; stir in almonds and cherries. Press mixture evenly into the bottom of prepared pan.",
        "Bake in the preheated oven until lightly golden at edges, about 20 minutes. Score with a sharp knife into bars while in the pan and still warm; allow cookies to cool about 30 minutes. Lift cookies from pan and slice to separate along scored marks.",
        "Melt white chocolate in a microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl in 30-second intervals, stirring after each melting, for 1 to 3 minutes (depending on your microwave). Do not overheat or chocolate will scorch. Drizzle melted white chocolate over cookies or dip half of each cookie into melted white chocolate."
