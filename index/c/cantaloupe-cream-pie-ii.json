Cook and stir until mixture comes to a low boil and begins to thicken. Beat egg yolks and water together in a small bowl. Gradually stir in small amounts of cantaloupe mixture to prevent yolks from curdling. Pour yolk mixture back into pan and continue cooking for 2 minutes more. Remove from heat and set aside to cool. Once cooled slightly, pour into pre-baked, cooled pie shell.",
