        "Pour the olive oil into the pot; stir in the garlic, ginger, onion, butternut squash, beets, red potatoes, carrots, and cabbage. Cook and stir for 10 minutes. Season with hot pepper sauce, dill, sage, thyme, salt, and pepper. Add the browned sausage, chicken broth, cream of mushroom soup, and vinegar. Bring to a simmer over high heat.
