Add the tomato sauce, crushed tomatoes, maple syrup, and kidney beans. Season with black pepper and chili powder. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to a simmer.",
        "Meanwhile, heat a large skillet over medium-high heat and stir in the ground beef. Sprinkle beef with salt. Cook and stir until the beef is crumbly, evenly browned, and no longer pink. Drain and discard any excess grease; stir into the chili along with 1 beer. Cook and stir for 1 hour, stirring frequently. Season to taste with salt, and thin to desired consistency with 1 beer before serving."
