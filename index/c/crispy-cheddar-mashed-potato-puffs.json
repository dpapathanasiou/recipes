        "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.  Shred 1/2 of cheese to make about 1 cup of shreds.  Divide shreds into 8 piles, about 2-inches apart, on a silicone baking mat or parchment paper lined cookie sheet and bake about 5 minutes or until cheese melts and becomes crisp. Let cool 5 minutes and remove from baking sheet. Reduce oven temperature to 180 degrees F.",
        "Cut the remaining 4 oz. cheese into 8 1/2-inch cubes.  Form balls of mashed potato mixture, using an ice cream scoop.  Make a small hole in center of each potato ball and fill with one cube Borden\u00ae Cheese. Cover with additional mashed potato so cheese is hidden inside. Refrigerate until ready to fry.",
        "Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat to 375 degrees F. Prepare beer batter according to package directions; dip each mashed potato ball into batter, and deep-fry for about 5 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from oil, and drain on paper towel. Reheat oil to 375 degrees F between batches. Keep potato puffs warm in the holding oven.",
