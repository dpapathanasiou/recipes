        "Combine milk, cream, and 1/3 cup sugar in a medium saucepan over medium heat; stir until the sugar dissolves, about 3 to 5 minutes. In a separate bowl, beat egg yolks and 1/3 cup sugar until the egg yolks are light in color, about 4 minutes. Stir 1/2 cup of the milk mixture into the egg yolks, then pour all of the egg mixture into the saucepan, stirring continuously. Cook, stirring continuously, until mixture thickens enough to coat the back of a metal spoon, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from heat.",
        "Add the chocolate hazelnut spread, espresso powder, and vanilla, stirring until well combined. Pour through a mesh strainer into a bowl. Refrigerate several hours until cold.",
        "Pour into an ice cream maker and freeze according to manufacturer's directions. Transfer gelato into an airtight container and place in freezer until solid.",
        "To make the tartufo: Scoop 4-ounce portions of gelato and form into balls using your hands. Poke a hole in each ball and place 1 cherry in each, cover with gelato, and place on a baking sheet. Roll gelato balls in the grated chocolate until coated and return to the freezer until ready to serve. Serve with whipped topping, if desired."
