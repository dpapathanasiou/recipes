        "In a very clean 1-quart glass jar combine the chilies and the vinegar and let the mixture steep, covered with the lid, in a cool dark place for at least 2 days and up to 2 weeks, depending on the strength desired. Strain the vinegar through a fine sieve into a glass pitcher, reserving 2 chilies for garnish and discarding the rest, and pour it into 2 very clean 1/2-pint glass jars. Add the reserved chiles and seal the jars with the lids."
