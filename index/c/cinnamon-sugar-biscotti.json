        "On a lightly floured surface, divide dough into  two pieces. Roll each piece into a log about 9 inches long and 1 1/2 inches wide. Place logs on the prepared baking sheet and flatten slightly. Brush with the beaten egg.",
        "Bake for 25 to 30 minutes in the preheated oven, until golden and firm to the touch. Cool for 15 minutes.",

Place back on the baking sheet, cut side down, and sprinkle with a mixture of the remaining cinnamon and sugar. Return to the oven for an additional 15 to 20 minutes, until toasted.
