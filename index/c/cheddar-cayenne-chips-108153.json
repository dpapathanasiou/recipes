        "Using largest holes on a box grater, coarsely shred enough cheese to measure 2 1/2 cups.",
        "Toss together cheese and cayenne in a bowl, then make 4 mounds of cheese (1 tablespoon each) about 2 inches apart in a 12-inch nonstick skillet. Cook over low heat (cheese will melt and spread), undisturbed, until bubbling and firm enough to lift, 4 to 5 minutes (do not turn over). Quickly transfer with a metal spatula to a rolling pin, allowing chips to drape over pin, and cool completely. Pour off fat from skillet and wipe clean with paper towels. Make more chips in same manner."
