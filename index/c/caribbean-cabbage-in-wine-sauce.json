Bring to a boil over medium heat, and place the ear of corn over the cabbage. Cover, and steam for 15 to 20 minutes, or until corn is tender. Remove the basket from the pot, and cool slightly.",

Combine the butter, vermouth, shallots, garlic, salt, pepper and red pepper flakes; pour over the cabbage, and stir to coat evenly.
