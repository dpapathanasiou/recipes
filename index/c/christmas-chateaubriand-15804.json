        "Pat tenderloin dry and rub with celery salt and black pepper. Cut bacon into 1 1/2-inch pieces. In a heavy kettle just large enough to hold tenderloin cook bacon over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until crisp and transfer with a slotted spoon to a small bowl. Pour off all but 1 tablespoon bacon fat. Increase heat to moderately high and brown tenderloin on all sides, about 5 minutes total. With tongs transfer tenderloin to a plate.",
        "To kettle add wine, bacon, and rosemary and boil mixture 1 minute. Return tenderloin to kettle and cook at a bare simmer, covered, turning occasionally, 25 minutes, or until an instant-read thermometer inserted diagonally 2 inches into center of beef registers 125\u00b0F. for medium-rare. With tongs transfer tenderloin to a cutting board and let stand 10 minutes.",
        "While tenderloin is standing, cut bell pepper into 1/4-inch dice. With a slotted spoon discard bacon from cooking liquid. Add bell pepper and demiglace to cooking liquid and boil sauce over moderate heat until slightly thickened and reduced to about 1 1/3 cups.",
        "Cut tenderloin into 1/4-inch-thick slices and arrange on a platter. Spoon some of sauce over tenderloin and garnish with rosemary sprigs. Serve remaining sauce on the side."
