        "Bring granulated sugar, corn syrup, a pinch of salt, and water to a boil in a 2-quart heavy saucepan over moderate heat, stirring constantly until sugar is dissolved. Continue to boil mixture, without stirring, until it turns a golden caramel. Remove pan from heat and carefully add cream and remaining 1/2 tablespoon vanilla (mixture will bubble up and steam).
