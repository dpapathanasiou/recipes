        "Bring milk and 1 cup cauliflower trimmings to a boil in a large saucepan; reduce heat and simmer until cauliflower is tender, 20-25 minutes. Let cool slightly, then transfer cauliflower mixture to a blender or use an immersion blender in the pan and pur\u00e9e until smooth.",
        "Return cauliflower pur\u00e9e to saucepan, add remaining cauliflower florets, and season with salt. Simmer until florets are just tender, 8-10 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer florets to a medium bowl (rinse off any pur\u00e9e on florets).",
