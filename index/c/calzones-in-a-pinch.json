        "Place a pie crust flat onto a work surface; spread with half the cream cheese, leaving an edge about 1/2-inch deep without cream cheese. Spoon half the filling over cream cheese. Fold the crust over the filling to make a large half moon-shaped calzone; press the edges together with a fork. Cut several slits in the top of the calzone to vent steam. Repeat with second crust and remaining filling. Place calzones onto a baking sheet. Brush tops with olive oil.",
        "Bake in the preheated oven until filling is hot, about 25 minutes. Sprinkle tops with Italian seasoning; return to oven and bake until crusts are lightly golden brown, about 5 more minutes. Let calzones stand for 5 minutes before cutting into servings."
