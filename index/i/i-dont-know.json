        "Place the potatoes in a large saucepan with enough water to cover. Bring to a boil, then simmer over medium heat until tender, about 5 minutes. Drain and set aside.",
        "Meanwhile, crumble the ground beef into a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook until evenly browned, stirring to break up large lumps. Drain excess grease from the beef and place in the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish. Pour the vegetable mixture over the beef, then arrange the potato slices over the vegetables. Season with salt and pepper. Sprinkle cheese over the top.",
        "Bake uncovered for 25 minutes in the preheated oven, until cheese is melted and the dish is heated through and bubbly."
