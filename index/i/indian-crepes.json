        "Heat a non-stick crepe pan over medium-high heat.",
        "Whisk flour and water together in a bowl. Add egg and mix well. Whisk butter, salt, and caraway seeds into flour mixture to form a smooth batter.",
        "Pour about 1/4 cup batter into heated pan. Tilt the pan around so the batter forms a nice round shape. Cook until bubbles form throughout the batter, 2 to 4 minutes. Flip the crepe by using spatula to loosen it from the pan. Flick your wrist upwards to give the crepe a toss, flipping it, and landing it back in the pan. Cook the second side until lightly browned, about 30 seconds. Repeat with remaining batter."
