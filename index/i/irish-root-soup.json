        "Pour 1 batch of the stock mixture into a blender, filling the pitcher no more than halfway. Hold the blender lid firmly in place and carefully start the blender; use a few quick pulses to get the mixture moving before leaving it on to puree. Repeat process with second batch. Return the pureed batches to the stockpot.",
        "Divide third batch into two equal batches. Puree only one of the two batches before returning both to the stockpot.",
