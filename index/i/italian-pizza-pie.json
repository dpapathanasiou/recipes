        "Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.",
        "Combine 4 cups flour with 1 cup shortening.  Add in 2 eggs and 1/2 cup cold water to make the crust. Separate dough into 2 portions, one for top and one for bottom. Roll bottom crust and place in the bottom of a 12x15 inch baking pan.",
        "When you buy the cold cuts you will buy them in chunk form. Dice each chunk into small pieces. Meanwhile cook pasta until almost done.",
        "When you're through cutting the cold cuts place them in a large mixing bowl. Place the cooled pasta on top. In a separate bowl beat 12 eggs. Add a little pepper to taste. Pour the eggs on top of cold cut mixture. Mix ingredients with your hands or a large spoon if you prefer.",
        "Place in the prepared bottom crust. Roll out the top crust and make 3 slits for air in the top. Place on top and bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for about 1 hour. ENJOY!"
