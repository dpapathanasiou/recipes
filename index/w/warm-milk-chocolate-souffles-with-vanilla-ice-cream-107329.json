Arrange souffl\u00e9 dishes on heavy large baking sheet. Stir milk chocolate and butter in medium metal bowl set over saucepan of simmering water until chocolate mixture is melted and smooth (do not allow bottom of bowl to touch water). Cool chocolate mixture to lukewarm.",
        "Using electric mixer, beat egg yolks, whole eggs, and sugar in large bowl until pale, thick, and tripled in volume, about 6 minutes. Fold 1/3 of egg mixture into lukewarm chocolate mixture to lighten. Gently fold chocolate mixture into remaining egg mixture. Spoon into prepared dishes, dividing equally. Smooth tops.",
        "Bake until souffl\u00e9s rise and edges are crisp and dark brown but centers are still soft, about 25 minutes. Dust tops with powdered sugar. Transfer to plates. Serve immediately, passing ice cream separately."
