Scrape in seeds from vanilla bean (reserve bean for another use). Beat until well combined, 1-2 minutes. Add ground-walnut mixture and beat just to blend. Gently fold in chopped walnuts, being careful not to overmix. Pour batter into prepared dish; smooth top. Sprinkle with remaining 3 tablespoons raw sugar.",
