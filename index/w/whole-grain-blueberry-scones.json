        "Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with silicone mat or parchment paper.",
        "Whisk together flour, baking powder, salt, baking soda, cinnamon, and nutmeg in a mixing bowl. Mix in sugar.",
        "Grate frozen butter into dry mixture with a cheese grater, tossing occasionally to prevent butter pieces from clumping together. Mixture should resemble coarse crumbs. If necessary, rub mixture between your fingers to break it down a bit more. Add blueberries and toss to distribute evenly. Stir buttermilk into dry mixture and stir just until dough is moistened.",
        "Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead briefly, for 5 or 6 turns. Pat or roll the dough out into a 1 1/2-inch thick rectangle. Cut dough into 4 equal rectangles. Cut each small rectangle diagonally into triangles. Transfer scones onto prepared baking sheet. Brush tops with buttermilk, and sprinkle with a pinch of demerara sugar.",
        "Bake scones in preheated oven until they are well browned and blueberry juices are bubbling through surface, about 25 minutes. Let cool before serving."
