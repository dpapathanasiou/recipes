        "Generously butter 13x9x1- inch baking sheet. Bring milk, broth, and bay leaf to simmer in heavy medium saucepan. Remove saucepan from heat; cover and let steep 20 minutes to allow flavors to develop. Discard bay leaf. Bring liquid to boil. Gradually add polenta, whisking constantly until smooth. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook until polenta is very thick, stirring frequently, about 10 minutes. Stir in Comt\u00e9 cheese and butter. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Transfer polenta to prepared 13x9x1-inch baking sheet. Using wet hands, press polenta evenly over sheet to edges. Chill until firm, at least 3 hours. Cut polenta into 20 squares. DO AHEAD: Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate.",
        "Melt 2 tablespoons butter with 2 tablespoons oil in large deep skillet over medium-high heat. Add all mushrooms and saut\u00e9 until tender and browned, stirring often, about 10 minutes. Add shallots and balsamic vinegar; saut\u00e9 until tender, about 2 minutes. Season lightly to taste with salt and pepper. DO AHEAD: Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate.",
        "Rewarm mushrooms in large skillet over medium-high heat until heated through. Add broth and simmer 1 minute. Stir in cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche and half of parsley. Season mushroom ragout to taste with salt and pepper. Remove from heat; cover to keep warm.",
        "Meanwhile, preheat oven to 300\u00b0F. Melt remaining 1 tablespoon butter with remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil in large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Working in batches, add polenta squares to skillet and cook until browned, about 2 1/2 minutes per side. Transfer to rimmed baking sheet and keep warm in oven while cooking remaining polenta squares.",
        "Arrange 2 polenta squares on each plate. Top each with warm mushroom ragout; sprinkle with grated Comt\u00e9 cheese and remaining parsley and serve.",
        "Comt\u00e9 is a semi-firm, Gruy\u00e8re-style cow's-milk cheese made primarily in France's Franche-Comt\u00e9 region. It adds great flavor to this recipe and would also be delicious on a cheese platter. Comt\u00e9 is available at some supermarkets, cheese shops, and specialty foods stores.",
        "*Polenta can be found at some supermarkets, as well as at natural foods stores and Italian markets. If polenta is unavailable, substitute an equal amount of regular yellow cornmeal and cook it about half as long."
