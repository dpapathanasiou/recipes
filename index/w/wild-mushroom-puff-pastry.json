        "Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add shallot; cook and stir until tender, about 5 minutes.  Lower heat to medium-low and add mushrooms.  Cook and stir until mushrooms reduce by half, about 15 minutes.  Stir in roasted garlic, Parmesan cheese, and thyme. Season to taste with salt and pepper.  Stir in cream.  Remove from heat and allow mushroom mixture to cool.  It will thicken as it cools.",
