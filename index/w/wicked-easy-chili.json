        "Heat olive oil in a pot over medium heat. Cook and stir onion, bell pepper, and jalapeno pepper in hot oil until tender, about 5 minutes. Break ground beef into small pieces and add to vegetable mixture; cook and stir, continuing to break beef into smaller pieces, until beef is completely browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Add garlic, seasoned salt, chili powder, oregano, cumin, red pepper flakes, and sugar to the beef mixture; cook and stir until you smell the garlic, about 1 minute more. Pour tomato sauce, black beans, and diced tomatoes into the pot; stir.",
