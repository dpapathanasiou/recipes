        "In a medium bowl, mix together the ground beef, onion, egg yolk, oregano, salt and pepper.",
        "Pick up medium sized handfuls and press them onto skewers. Roll on a lightly oiled clean surface until the mixture looks like a large ground beef hot dog with about 1 1/2 inches at each end of the skewer. Place your fingers in the middle of the skewer and separate the meat log into two sausages with about 1 inch of skewer sticking out at each end.",
        "Prepare a grill for high heat, or if you only have a grill pan, like myself, heat it over medium-high heat.",
        "Place the sausages on the grilling surface, and cook for about 10 minutes, turning once or twice for even cooking. Serve immediately."
