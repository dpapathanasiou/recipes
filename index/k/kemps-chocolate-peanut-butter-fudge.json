        "Dollop spoonfuls of peanut butter mixture into prepared pan. Immediately spoon chocolate mixture in small dollops over and around peanut butter mixture. Swirl mixtures together with a knife. (The key to easy swirling is to have the peanut butter mixture very warm when the chocolate mixture is added, and to add the chocolate immediately.) Chill fudge, uncovered, until firm, about 1 hour.",
