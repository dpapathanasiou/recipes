        "Grind the cumin seed, coriander seed, black peppercorns, cinnamon, cloves, cardamom pod, and fennel seed into a coarse powder; sprinkle over the mixture in the skillet. Add the water, coconut milk powder, ground red pepper, and salt. Cook until the chicken is tender, about 30 minutes. If the curry is too wet, cook on high until the moisture evaporates. Garnish with cilantro and serve hot."
