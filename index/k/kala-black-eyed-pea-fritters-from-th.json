        "Place black-eyed peas into a container, and cover with several inches of water. Allow to stand for 12 hours.",
        "Drain the water from the black-eyed peas. Place peas into the bowl of a food processor, and pulse until coarsely ground. Stir in the egg whites, salt, flour, and cayenne pepper to taste until dough consistency. Add more flour if necessary to hold the mixture together. Form into small balls, each about 2 inches diameter.",
        "Heat the oil in a heavy, deep skillet to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) over medium-high heat. Carefully drop the balls into the hot oil, and fry until brown, about 5 minutes. You may need to lower the heat slightly after cooking the first kala balls. Turn frequently to brown evenly on all sides."
