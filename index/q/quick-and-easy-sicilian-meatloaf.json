Place the meat mixture down on the piece of parchment paper, and pat it into a rectangle shape about 10x16 inches. Lay deli ham slices down on the meat, keeping a 1-inch margin around all sides of the rectangle. Sprinkle Swiss cheese over the ham. Carefully lift up the short edge of the meat square with the parchment paper, and gently nudge and roll up the meat. Seal the edges and ends well. Place the meat roll into a 9x13-inch baking dish.",
