        "Whisk quinoa flour, almond milk, eggs, honey, and sea salt together in a bowl until batter is smooth. Stir butter into batter.",
        "Heat a lightly greased a skillet or griddle over medium-low heat. Pour 1/4 cup batter into the skillet and immediately rotate the skillet until the batter evenly coats the bottom in a thin layer. Cook until the top of the crepe is no longer wet and the bottom has turned light brown, about 2 minutes. Run a spatula around the edge of the skillet to loosen; flip crepe and cook until the other side has turned light brown, about 30 seconds. Repeat with remaining batter."
