Thinly slice the remaining 1/3 onion and 1/2 bell pepper; cook and stir with chicken and mushrooms in the hot oil until vegetables are just tender, 5 to 10 minutes. Add roasted green chile peppers, chili powder, oregano, 1 pinch garlic salt, and 1 pinch black pepper; cook and stir until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir enough enchilada sauce into vegetable mixture just to coat.",
