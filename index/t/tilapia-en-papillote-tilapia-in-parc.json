        "Prepare 4 sheets of parchment paper by folding each sheet in half and placing a tilapia fillet centered onto one side of the fold of each sheet. Season the tilapia with salt and black pepper. Top the fillets with equal amounts of tomato, garlic, basil, and capers. Sprinkle lemon juice over the fillets. Place 1 tablespoon butter atop the fish. Drizzle white wine over the fillets.",
