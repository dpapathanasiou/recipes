        "Unfold the other sheet of pastry and cut four 1 inch strips from the longest side. Place each strip along each edge of egg-washed pastry, forming a thicker edge. Discard unused pastry. Lightly brush strips with beaten egg.  Reserve remaining egg. Pierce pastry inside formed edges several times with a fork.",
