        "Place the shredded potatoes in a cloth, and wring as much of the moisture out as possible. Place the potatoes into a bowl, and stir in the onion soup mix, garlic, eggs, flour, Cheddar cheese, salt, and pepper until well mixed.",
        "Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat until it shimmers, and drop the potato mixture by heaping tablespoons into the hot oil. Press down on the patties to flatten them to about 1/3 inch thick. Fry the patties until golden brown and crisp on the bottoms, 5 to 8 minutes, then flip and cook the other side until crisp and golden. Remove the latkes to paper towels to drain, and serve hot, sprinkled with green onion and a small dollop of sour cream."
