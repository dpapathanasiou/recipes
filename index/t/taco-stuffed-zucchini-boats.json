        "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease the bottom of a 13x9-inch baking dish.",
        "Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Cook zucchini halves in boiling water to just soften slightly, about 1 minute. Remove zucchini halves from the water and arrange into the prepared baking dish with the cut sides facing upwards.",
        "Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir ground turkey in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease.",
        "Return skillet to medium-high heat; pour water over the turkey and season with taco seasoning. Cook until the water thickens and coats the turkey, about 5 minutes. Add red peppers, diced tomatoes and green chiles, onion, and cilantro; cook and stir until the peppers are softened, about 5 minutes more.",
        "Stir sour cream and sour cream seasoning mix together in a bowl.",
        "Using a slotted spoon, spoon the turkey mixture into the hollows of each zucchini half and press firmly. Top the turkey mixture with about half the sour cream mixture. Sprinkle green onions, Muenster cheese, and Cheddar cheese over the sour cream mixture, respectively.",
        "Bake in the preheated oven until the cheese is melted and the zucchini is cooked through, about 30 minutes. Top with remaining sour cream mixture."
