On a cloth covered board, dusted generously with sugar, roll dough out to 1/16 inch thick. Cut the dough into 2 1/2 inch squares.  Spread 1 teaspoon of filling onto each square, bring the corners to the center and press lightly to seal. Place them onto an ungreased cookie sheet about 2 inches apart.",
