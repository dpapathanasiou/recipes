        "In a bowl stir together flour, confectioners' sugar, and salt. With a pastry blender or fingertips blend in butter until mixture resembles coarse meal. In a small bowl stir together egg yolk and cold water. Add yolk mixture to flour mixture, 1 tablespoon at a time, tossing to incorporate until mixture forms a dough. On a work surface smear dough in several forward motions with heel of hand to develop gluten in flour and make dough easier to work with. Scrape dough together to form a ball and flatten to a 1-inch-thick disk. Chill dough, wrapped in plastic wrap, 30 minutes.",

        "Preheat oven to 400\u00b0F.",
        "On a lightly floured surface roll out dough to a 15-inch round and transfer to a large baking sheet. Fold in edge 1 inch all around to form a border.",
        "Arrange apple slices on pastry round in overlapping concentric circles. Brush apple slices and pastry border with wine remaining in bowl and sprinkle with sugar.",
