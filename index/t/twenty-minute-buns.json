        "In a large mixing bowl, dissolve yeast and sugar in warm water. Let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes.",
        "Add oil, 2 cups of flour and the salt; stir well to combine. Add the remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time, stirring well after each addition. When the dough has pulled together, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes. Lightly oil a large bowl, place the dough in the bowl and turn to coat with oil. Cover with a damp cloth and let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 40 minutes.",
        "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13 inch baking pan.",
        "Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and divide into three equal pieces. Divide each big piece into 6 small ones. Form the pieces into rounds. Place the rounds into the prepared pan. Cover the rolls with a damp cloth  or plastic wrap and let rise until doubled in volume, about 20 minutes.",
        "Beat together the egg white and water. Gently brush the risen rolls with the egg wash and then bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 15 minutes or until the rolls are golden brown."
