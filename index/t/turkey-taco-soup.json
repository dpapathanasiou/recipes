        "In the same skillet, stir in the onion; cook and stir until the onion is nearly translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the carrots and celery. Continue to cook and stir until tender, about 8 more minutes.",
        "Stir in the corn, garlic, taco seasoning, cumin, chili powder, dried oregano, and about 1/4 cup cilantro along with the cooked turkey. Cook and stir until fragrant, about 2 minutes.",
        "Mix in the tomatoes, kidney beans, green chile pepper, olives, chicken broth, water, and lime juice. Season with salt and black pepper. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low and continue to simmer for 20 minutes. Remove chile halves, and garnish with the remaining cilantro before serving."
