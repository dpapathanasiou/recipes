Add wine, raise heat to high, and bring to boil. Lower heat to moderately high and simmer vigorously, uncovered, until the liquid has reduced by 2/3, 4 to 5 minutes. Add stock, cinnamon stick, and cardamom pod, raise heat to high and bring to boil. Reduce heat to moderate and simmer until mixture is thick enough to lightly coat back of spoon, 30 to 45 minutes.

        "Using tongs, transfer breasts, skin side up, to rack in wok, arranging about 1 inch apart. Heat wok over high heat, uncovered, until steady wisps of smoke begin to appear, 5 to 10 minutes. Reduce heat to moderate, then cover wok and, using oven mitts, fold foil overhang from wok and lid together, crimping to seal tightly (foil will be very hot). Smoke duck breasts 10 minutes.",

        "When breasts have smoked 10 minutes, carefully unwrap foil (smoke and steam will billow out). Using tongs, transfer breasts to baking dish and place in oven. Transfer potatoes to rimmed baking sheet and place alongside duck in oven. Roast duck to desired doneness, 7 to 8 minutes for medium-rare (instant-read thermometer inserted into breasts will read 135\u00b0F). Transfer breasts to carving board, tent with foil, and let rest 5 minutes before slicing. When potatoes are warm, remove from oven, cover and keep warm.",

        "If necessary, rewarm sauce over low heat. Stir in blueberries.",

Arrange slices on top of potatoes. Place 1 pear half on side of each plate and arrange vegetables on other side. Spoon blueberry jus over plates and serve immediately."
