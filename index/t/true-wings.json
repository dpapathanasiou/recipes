        "Place wings in a large glass bowl. Sprinkle 1 1/2 tablespoons garlic powder, 1 tablespoon onion powder, 1 tablespoon paprika, 1 tablespoon chili powder, 1 tablespoon cumin, sazon seasoning, and 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper over chicken wings and rub spices into wings to coat completely. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate, 1 hour to overnight.",
        "Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and spray with cooking spray.",
        "Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat; whisk hot sauce and syrup into butter. Add brown sugar, 1 1/2 tablespoons garlic powder, 1 tablespoon cumin, 1 tablespoon onion powder, 1 tablespoon paprika, 1 tablespoon chili powder, and 3/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper; whisk until well-combined and the sauce is hot, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from heat.",
        "Pour flour into a shallow bowl. Gently press the chicken wings into the flour to coat and shake off any excess.",
        "Working in batches, cook wings in hot oil until the skin is golden and crispy, the meat is no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, 5 to 10 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Transfer wings to a plate lined with a paper towel to drain excess oil.",
        "Dip each chicken wing in the hot sauce mixture and place on the prepared baking sheet.",
        "Bake in the preheated oven until sauce starts to caramelize, about 20 minutes."
