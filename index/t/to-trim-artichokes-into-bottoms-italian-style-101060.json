        "Halve lemon. Into a bowl of cold water squeeze juice from 1 lemon half and drop squeezed half into water. Do not cut off stems of artichokes. Working with 1 artichoke at a time, bend back outer leaves until they snap off close to base and discard several more layers of leaves in same manner until exposed leaves are pale green at top and pale yellow at base.",
        "With a sharp stainless-steel knife cut off remaining leaves, discarding them (you should have just heart and stem of artichoke). Trim dark green fibrous parts from base of artichoke, being careful not to break off stem. Cut a thin slice from end of stem to expose a fresh cross section. Trim outer green fibrous part from stem, leaving pale core intact. Halve artichoke hearts lengthwise and with a melon-ball cutter or grapefruit spoon scrape out choke and spiky purple-tipped leaves. Rub artichoke all over with cut side of remaining lemon half and put artichoke in bowl of lemon water. Trim remaining artichokes in same manner."
