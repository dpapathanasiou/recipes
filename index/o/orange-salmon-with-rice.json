        "Bring the rice and water to a boil in a saucepan over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the rice is tender, and the liquid has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes. Meanwhile, season salmon fillets with salt and pepper.",
        "Spray a large skillet with cooking spray and heat over medium-high heat. Place salmon fillets into the skillet and cook until golden, about 3 minutes on each side. Cover and reduce heat to medium and continue cooking until the salmon flakes easily with a fork, 2 to 3 minutes longer. Remove salmon from the skillet and set aside. Stir orange juice and soy sauce into the same skillet. Cook on high heat until slightly thickened, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in the sesame oil. Spoon sauce over the salmon and serve with rice."
