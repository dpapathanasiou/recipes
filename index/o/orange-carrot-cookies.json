        "In a large bowl, cream together the shortening and sugar until light and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well with each addition, then stir in the vanilla and carrots. Combine the flour, baking powder and salt; gradually stir into the creamed mixture. Finally, fold in the walnuts. Drop by rounded spoonfuls onto the prepared cookie sheet.",
        "Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven, until lightly golden. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.",
        "To make the glaze, put 1 cup of the confectioners' sugar into a medium bowl. Grate the rind of the orange into the bowl with the sugar. Squeeze in enough juice from the orange to form a thin but spreadable consistency. Mix until smooth. If necessary, stir in more confectioners' sugar. Spread onto the cooled cookies. Store in an airtight container."
