        "In a small saucepan, heat milk until hot, but not boiling; mix in 1/2 cup sugar, salt, lemon zest, and butter. Remove from heat, and cool slightly. In a small bowl, mix together yeast, 1 teaspoon sugar, and 1/4 cup water; stir into milk. Beat in 2 eggs and egg yolks. Mix in 3 cups flour. Cover, and let rise in a warm place.",
        "Mix in the raisins and nuts. Gradually mix in enough of the remaining flour to form a soft dough. Place dough in a well-oiled bowl, cover, and set aside to rise.",
        "Divide dough into 3 balls. Roll each ball out into a thick log, braid, and tuck the ends under.  Place on a large cookie sheet, and set aside to rise one more time.",
        "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Brush beaten egg over the dough. It gives a shine to it.",
        "Bake in preheated oven for 45 minutes."
