        "Melt 1/4 cup butter in heavy medium skillet over medium-low heat. Add onion and saut\u00e9 until very tender, about 15 minutes. Transfer to large bowl of electric mixer fitted with dough hook.",
        "Add 1 cup warm water to onion. Mix in yeast, sugar and salt. Using mortar and pestle, crush 2 teaspoons fennel seeds. Add to onion mixture. Mix in enough flour 1/2 cup at a time to form medium-soft dough. Knead dough on floured surface until smooth and elastic, about 4 minutes. Allow dough to remain on floured work surface; cover with towel and let stand until beginning to rise, about 20 minutes.",
        "Butter heavy large baking sheet. Knead dough briefly. Divide dough into 4 equal pieces. Form each piece into ball; flatten into 3/4-inch-thick round, about 5 inches in diameter. Arrange rounds on prepared baking sheet. Rub tops with remaining 2 teaspoons butter. Sprinkle remaining 2 teaspoons whole fennel seeds evenly over rounds and press gently to adhere. Cover with towel. Let rise in warm draft-free area until puffy, about 30 minutes.",
        "Meanwhile, preheat oven to 450 \u00b0F. Bake breads until golden, about 25 minutes. Serve warm."
