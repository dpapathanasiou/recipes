        "Remove pork from marinade and pour marinade into a small saucepan. Cook marinade over medium-low heat until bubbling, about 5 minutes.",
        "Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook pork in the hot oil, basting with marinade, until browned, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Reduce heat to low and cook pork, basting occasionally with marinade, until no longer pink in the center, 15 to 25 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C)."
