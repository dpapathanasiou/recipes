        "Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Stir the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, cinnamon, cloves, and salt together in a bowl.",
        "Beat the sugar and margarine with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. Beat the first egg into the butter until completely blended; beat the vanilla into the mixture with the last egg. Stir the zucchini through the mixture until evenly distributed. Mix the flour mixture into the zucchini mixture until just incorporated. Fold in the chocolate chips, mixing just enough to evenly combine. Roll the dough into walnut-sized balls and place 2 inches apart onto ungreased baking sheets.",
        "Bake in batches in the preheated oven until the edges are golden, about 10 minutes. Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 1 minute before removing to a wire rack to cool completely."
