        "Place tomatillos, jalapenos, and garlic in a large pot.  Pour in just enough water to cover the tomatillos; they will float, so press them down with your hand as you measure the water.  Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until the color of the tomatillos lightens to a yellow color, about 10 minutes.  Remove from heat, and allow to cool for about 10 minutes.",
        "Strain the tomatillos, reserving the water.  Place into the bowl of a blender; add the cloves, cumin, pepper, and chicken bouillon.  Puree until smooth, use the reserved water as needed to adjust the consistency."
