        "Bring sugar, water, corn syrup, and maple syrup to a boil in a large skillet over medium-high heat, stirring constantly. Heat to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C), or until a small amount of syrup dropped into cold water forms a rigid ball.",
        "Stir pecans and vanilla into syrup mixture until mixture begins to turn brown; add bacon. Cook until bacon mixture turns light brown, 1 to 3 minutes. Remove from heat and stir baking soda into bacon mixture. Pour brittle out onto a sheet of parchment paper set on a heat-proof surface and cool brittle to room temperature before breaking into pieces, at least 30 minutes."
