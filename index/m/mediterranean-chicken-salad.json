(Don't use the leftover chicken marinade!)  The peppers will need only a few minutes - be careful not to burn them!",
        "Remove chicken and peppers from the grill and, when cool enough to handle, slice into strips.  Arrange peppers and chicken on top of the salad and serve with the last 1/2 cup of dressing."
