        "In a large bowl, mix together the ground beef and onion soup mix. Divide into 8 balls and then flatten into thin patties. Place a quarter of the bacon mixture onto each of four patties. Top with the remaining patties and press the edges together to seal.",
        "Grill the burgers for about 15 minutes, turning once, until well done. Serve on buns with your favorite condiments."
