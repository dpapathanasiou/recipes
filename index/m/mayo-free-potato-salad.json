        "Place the potatoes into a large pot and cover with water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain and allow to steam dry for a minute or two. Chill the potatoes in cold water, and chop into cubes when cool enough to handle.",
        "Transfer the potatoes into a large salad bowl, and toss lightly with dill pickles, green onions, celery, cilantro, dill pickle juice, dried dill,  1 teaspoon paprika, salt, and pepper. In a bowl, whisk together the olive oil, red wine vinegar, and Dijon mustard, and pour the dressing over the potato mixture. Toss again to coat all ingredients with dressing. Sprinkle with 1/4 teaspoon paprika."
