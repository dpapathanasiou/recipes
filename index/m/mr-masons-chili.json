        "Place the ground beef and half the chili powder into a large saucepan over high heat, and cook until meat is browned, breaking the meat apart into crumbles as it cooks, about 10 minutes. Mix in the onion, and cook and stir until onion is softened, about 10 more minutes. Stir in garlic, and cook until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Stir in remaining chili powder, cumin, oregano, tomato paste, and cocoa powder, and cover pan.",
        "Reduce heat to a simmer, and cook until meat is tender and flavors have blended, mixing enough water to make a thick chili, about 1 1/2 hours. Stir occasionally."
