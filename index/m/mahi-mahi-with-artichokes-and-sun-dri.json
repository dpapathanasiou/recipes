        "Stir tomatoes and artichoke hearts into the reduced sauce; cook until warmed, 2 to 3 minutes more. Remove skillet from heat, add cold butter pieces, and swirl skillet off heat until the butter melts and emulsifies into the sauce.",

        "Heat olive oil in a separate skillet over medium heat. Pan-fry mahi mahi in the oil until the fish flakes easily with a fork in the center, 3 to 5 minutes per side. Transfer mahi mahi to a platter; top with the sauce."
