        "Pour boiling water over lime-flavored gelatin and unflavored gelatin in a bowl.",

        "Pour ice water into gelatin mixture and stir until ice is melted, 2 to 3 minutes.",
        "Pour gelatin mixture into a clear glass bowl. Stretch a piece of plastic wrap over the bowl, and refrigerate gelatin until still soft but beginning to set, 10 to 15 minutes.",
        "While gelatin is setting up, carve pear into a shark shape with a small, sharp knife. Cut wide end of pear into the head, carve back and side fins, and carve the narrow end into the tail.",
        "Remove plastic wrap from bowl, and gently insert pieces of dill \"seaweed\" into the gelatin. Immerse the pear shark into the gelatin. Cover the bowl back up with the plastic wrap.",
        "Use a long skewer or cake tester to puncture the plastic wrap and skewer the shark vertically through the middle to help it stay in position as gelatin sets up. Refrigerate until firm, 2 to 4 hours.",
        "Carefully remove skewer from shark and remove plastic wrap before serving."
