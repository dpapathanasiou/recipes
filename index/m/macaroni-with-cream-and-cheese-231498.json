        "Lay poblanos on their sides on racks of gas burners, then turn flames on moderately high. Roast poblanos, turning occasionally with tongs, until skins are blistered and charred, 4 to 6 minutes. (Alternatively, broil poblanos on a broiler pan about 2 inches from heat, turning occasionally with tongs, 8 to 10 minutes.) Transfer poblanos immediately to a large bowl and cover. Let steam 10 minutes, then peel or rub off skins and discard stems, seeds, and ribs. Cut poblanos into 1/4-inch-thick strips.",
        "Cook onion with salt in butter in a 12-inch heavy skillet over moderately low heat, stirring occasionally, until onion is golden, 10 to 12 minutes. Add poblanos, serrano, garlic, and oregano and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Remove from heat.",
        "While onion is browning, cook pasta in a large pot of boiling salted water until tender, 14 to 15 minutes. Reserve 1/4 cup pasta-cooking water, then drain pasta in a colander. Add pasta to chile mixture along with crema and reserved cooking water. Increase heat to high and cook, tossing, until pasta is well coated, about 1 minute. Stir in cheese."
