        "Place potatoes into a large pot, and fill with enough water to cover. Bring to a boil, and cook until tender, about 8 minutes.",
        "Meanwhile, fry bacon in a large skillet over medium-high heat until evenly browned and crisp. Remove bacon from the skillet to drain on paper towels. Add the onions to the bacon grease in the skillet, and fry until tender, stirring constantly. Drain excess grease.",
        "When the potatoes are done, drain the water and mash. Mix in buttermilk to get your desired creamy consistency. Crumble in the bacon, and stir in the onions. Those who are not worried about fat can also stir in about 2 tablespoons of bacon grease.",
        "Serve potatoes on small plates with a bowl of buttermilk on the side of each one. Dip spoonfuls of mashed potatoes into buttermilk before eating."
