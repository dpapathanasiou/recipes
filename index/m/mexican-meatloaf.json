        "Place the ground beef mixture on a large piece of foil. Press the mixture into an approximately 1 inch thick square shape. Spread the refried beans evenly over the top of the flattened beef. Layer the flour tortillas on top of the refried beans, trimming the edges to fit the square. Layer tortillas with salsa and Cheddar cheese, staying 1/2 to 1 inch away from edges of the square.",
