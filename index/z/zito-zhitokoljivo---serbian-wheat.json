        "Bring a kettle of water to boil. Continue to refill and heat as needed as the source for water in boiling the wheat.",
        "Place wheat berries in a 2- to 3-quart saucepan. Cover with water, about two inches above the level of the berries. Bring to a rolling boil and let boil for 15 seconds. Drain; discard water.",
        "Add new water to the wheat, the same amount as before. Repeat until you've brought wheat and water to a boil seven times. During the seventh boil, add the salt. Do not drain.",
        "Remove the pan from the heat, cover, and wrap with towels (see Cook's Note). Let rest at room temperature overnight.",
        "The next day, drain any water that hasn't been absorbed overnight. Grind the wheat berries thoroughly in a food processor or a meat grinder. (If you use a blender, you must work in very small batches.) Transfer wheat to a bowl and set aside. Grind the walnuts until fine; add the confectioners' sugar and process until nuts form a fine meal. Add the ground wheat and pulse until mixed.",
        "Spoon koljivo into a serving dish, preferably a clear glass trifle bowl with straight sides. Garnish by sticking slivered almonds all over the top, like a porcupine.",
        "Whip the cream in a glass or metal bowl with electric mixer on high speed until stiff peaks form. Serve by the heaping tablespoon in small decorative bowls or custard cups, topped with a dollop of whipped cream."
