Fit rounds into tart pans with removable bottoms measuring 4 inches across top and 3/4 inch deep and roll a rolling pin over pan edges to trim excess dough. Pastry shells may be prepared 5 days in advance and kept covered and frozen on a baking sheet. Let shells stand at room temperature 10 minutes before continuing with recipe.",
