        "Peel, core, and chop coarse 1 of the pears. In a small dry non-stick skillet saut\u00e9 the pear over moderately high heat, stirring occasionally, for 5 to 6 minutes, or until it is tender and golden, and transfer it to a small food processor. In the skillet, cleaned and dried, melt the sugar over moderately low heat, stirring with a fork, and cook the syrup, swirling the skillet gently, until it is a light caramel. Remove the skillet from the heat, pour the heavy cream carefully down the side of the skillet, and whisk the mixture until the caramel is dissolved and the mixture is smooth. Add the caramel to the food processor, blending it with the cooked pear until it is smooth. Stir in the vanilla and keep the sauce warm.",
        "Peel, halve, and core the remaining 2 pears. In the skillet, cleaned, melt the butter over moderately low heat, add the zest and the pears, and cook the pears for 4 to 5 minutes on each side, or until they are tender. Divide the pears between 2 plates and spoon the pear sauce over them."
