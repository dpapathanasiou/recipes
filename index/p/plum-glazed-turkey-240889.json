        "1. Prepare the Giblet Broth one day ahead: Simmer the chicken broth, giblets and neck in a saucepan until the giblets are tender, about 1 hour. Strain the broth into a bowl; cover and refrigerate. Shred the meat from the neck and finely chop the giblets; cover and refrigerate.",
        "2. Preheat oven to 325\u00b0F. Prepare the turkey: Squeeze the orange inside the body and neck cavities; sprinkle with paprika, salt and pepper. Stuff loosely with Cranberry Fennel Stuffing , using about 3 cups for the neck and 8 cups for the body. Close the turkey with lacers or sew with a large needle and heavy thread; tie legs together. Rub bird with the butter; sprinkle with paprika, salt and pepper.",
        "3. Place a rack in a large roasting pan and cover with 2 long pieces of heavy-duty foil, lengthwise and crosswise. Place the turkey, breast-side up, on top of the foil. Pour 2 cups of the Giblet Broth into the pan. Close the foil loosely over the turkey. Roast for 1 1/2 hours.",
        "4. Open up the foil and roast the turkey, basting with pan juices every 30 minutes, for 2 1/2 hours. If the turkey starts to get too brown, tent it loosely with the foil.",
        "5. Raise the oven temperature to 350\u00b0F and cook the turkey for 1 more hour or until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh reads 170\u00b0F. The temperature in the breast should read 160\u00b0F, and the juices should run clear when the thigh is pricked with a sharp knife. During the last 15 minutes of roasting, brush the turkey with the Plum Glaze . Transfer the turkey to a platter. Let the turkey rest, loosely covered with foil, for 20 minutes before carving. Remove the stuffing to a serving dish and cover.",
        "6. Present the turkey, garnished with the grapes and sage, before carving. Arrange the carved meat on a large, decorative platter and serve with hot Giblet Gravy."
