        "Melt the butter in a large pot over medium heat; cook and stir the onion and garlic in the melted butter until softened, about 5 minutes. Stir the water and chicken bouillon cubes into the mixture; cook and stir until the bouillon cubes have dissolved, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir the pumpkin puree, coconut milk, ginger, orange juice, pumpkin pie spice, and chili powder into the liquid. Bring the soup to a simmer, and cook until heated through, 5 to 7 minutes.",
        "Pour the soup into a blender pitcher to no more than half full. Hold down the lid of the blender firmly in place. Start the blender, using a few quick pulses to get the soup moving before leaving it on to puree. Puree in batches until smooth, and pour into a clean pot. Alternately, you can use a stick blender and puree the soup in the pot.",
        "Return the pureed soup to medium heat; bring to a simmer and cook another 10 minutes."
