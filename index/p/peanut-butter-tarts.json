        "In a medium bowl, cream the  shortening, brown sugar, and white sugar. Stir in the egg, then the peanut butter.  Sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt; stir this into the creamed mixture. Refrigerate dough for 1 hour.",
        "Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease a mini muffin pan.",
        "Roll the dough into walnut sized balls and place into mini muffin cups; flatten slightly. Bake in preheated oven for 8 to 10 minutes, cookies should be light brown.",
        "While the cookies are baking, unwrap the mini peanut butter cups. Press mini peanut butter cups down into the center of the cookie tarts while they are hot from the oven. Allow cookies to cool slightly before removing from the pan. For special occasions, smooth off the top of the mini peanut butter cup with a small knife or spatula, and using a pastry bag, pipe a small star of whipped topping onto the center of each tart."
