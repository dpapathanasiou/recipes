        "Dissolve yeast in warm water in a large bowl; add pumpkin, brown sugar, cinnamon, salt, nutmeg, allspice, and cloves and mix well. Stir in enough flour to make a soft dough. Turn dough onto a work surface and knead by hand 6 to 8 minutes or mix in a stand mixer. Transfer dough to a greased bowl, cover with a damp towel, and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1 hour.",
        "Punch dough down and divide into 8 balls. Poke a hole in the middle of each ball using your finger to create a bagel shape. Arrange bagels on a baking sheet and let rise, 10 to 15 minutes.",
        "Fill a large pot with 6 cups water and white sugar and bring to a boil. Slightly flatten the bagels and drop a couple at a time into the boiling water; cook for 1 1/2 minutes. Flip bagels and boil for another 1 1/2 minutes; remove with a slotted spoon and dry on a clean towel. Repeat with remaining bagels.",
        "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spray a baking sheet with cooking spray and sprinkle cornmeal on the sheet. Arrange bagels on the baking sheet about 2 inches apart.",
        "Bake in the preheated oven until cooked through, 25 to 30 minutes."
