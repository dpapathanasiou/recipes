        "Return skillet to heat and add white wine.  Scrape bottom of pan with spatula to remove any bits from browning the tuna.  Reduce heat to medium and add shallot and garlic.  Cook and stir until shallot is clear, approximately 3 to 5 minutes.  Stir in blood orange juice. Boil until the liquid has reduced to half its original volume or until it thickens.  Remove from heat.",
