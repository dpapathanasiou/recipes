        "Place bacon slices in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels; set aside to cool.",
        "Heat cream, butter, and garlic together in a small saucepan over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until butter is melted, about 5 minutes. Add Parmesan cheese; stir until melted. Reduce heat to low and simmer sauce, uncovered, until thick, about 5 minutes.",
        "Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease 2 pizza pans.",

        "Stir oil into yeast mixture. Mix in flour, 1 cup at a time, until dough starts to come together. Turn out dough onto a well-floured surface. Knead, adding more flour as you work, until dough is no longer sticky. Divide dough into 2 pieces and roll out to the size of your pizza pans; transfer to greased pans.",
