        "In a large mixing bowl, combine condensed milk and peppermint extract.  Beat in enough confectioners' sugar, a little at a time, to form a stiff dough that is no longer sticky.  Form into 1 inch balls, then place on waxed paper and flatten with fingers to form patties.  Let patties dry at room temperature two hours, turning once.",
        "In a medium saucepan over low heat, melt chocolate with shortening, stirring often.  Remove from heat.  Dip patties, one at a time, into chocolate by laying them on the tines of a fork and lowering the fork into the liquid.  Let cool on waxed paper until set."
