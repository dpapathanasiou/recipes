Stir until combined into a smooth batter, and pour into the prepared loaf pan.",

        "Place 1 cup of confectioners' sugar in a bowl. In a separate small bowl, mix the non-dairy creamer with water, and stir in 1 tablespoon of confectioners' sugar. Stir the creamer mixture into the confectioners' sugar by teaspoons until the mixture forms an even, workable glaze. Mix in 1/2 teaspoon of lemon extract. Spread the glaze over the cooled lemon loaf.
