        "Spray bamboo steamer basket or large metal steamer rack with nonstick spray. Add enough water to large skillet to reach depth of 1 inch. Bring water to boil; reduce to simmer.",
        "Meanwhile, whisk flour, baking powder, and kosher salt in medium bowl to blend. Using fingertips, rub butter into dry ingredients until incorporated. Add milk and chopped parsley and stir just to blend. Drop small walnut-size mounds of dough into prepared steamer basket, spacing dumplings apart. Set steamer basket atop simmering water and cover tightly. Steam dumplings until cooked through, about 10 minutes. DO AHEAD: Dumplings can be made 3 hours ahead. Cool, cover, and let stand at room temperature."
