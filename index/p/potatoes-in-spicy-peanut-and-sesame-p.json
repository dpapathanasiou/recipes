        "Heat oil in a medium saucepan over medium-low heat. Add cloves, cardamom pods, cinnamon, cumin seeds, mustard seeds, and curry leaf. Stir in onions, and cook until soft and translucent. Mix in ginger garlic paste, and cook, stirring constantly, 1 minute. Stir in tomato, and cook about 5 minutes.",
        "Add chili powder, green chilies, turmeric, and salt. Stir in half of the mint and half of the cilantro. Add peanut and sesame paste, stirring vigorously to prevent sticking. Stir in potatoes, mixing well to coat. Pour in enough water to not quite cover potatoes, and mix thoroughly. Stir in remaining mint and cilantro, and cover; cook on low heat, stirring occasionally, until the potatoes are soft and the sauce is reduced to a creamy paste, about 30 minutes."
