        "Place coconut into a blender and pulse several times; blend until coconut becomes a fine powder. Combine coconut, almond flour, whey protein powder, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon in a medium bowl.",
        "Mix together 1/2 cup mashed banana, milk, vanilla extract, and maple syrup in a small bowl.",
        "Separate the whites from the yolks of the 2 eggs; transfer all 3 egg whites to a metal bowl. Mix 2 egg yolks into the banana mixture. Beat egg whites until foamy using an electric mixer, beating until stiff peaks form. Lift your beater or whisk straight up: the egg whites will form sharp peaks.",

        "Ladle batter into preheated waffle iron in the amount recommended by manufacturer. Close lid and cook waffle until golden and crisp, 3 to 4 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter. Top waffles with remaining 1 mashed banana."
