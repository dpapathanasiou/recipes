        "Combine mangos, pineapple, and cider vinegar in a stockpot over medium-high heat. Bring to a a simmer; mash mangos and pineapple to a chunky consistency with a potato masher. Stir in sugar until dissolved.",
        "Stir liquid pectin and habanero chile halves into the stockpot. Bring to a rolling boil, stirring frequently. Cook, stirring frequently, until jam thickens, about 2 minutes more. Remove chile halves. Discard 6 chile halves; chop 2 halves and stir back into the stockpot.",
        "Sterilize 8 half-pint jars and lids in boiling water for at least 5 minutes.",
        "Ladle hot jam into hot, sterilized jars, filling to within 1/4 inch of the top. Run a clean knife around the insides of the jars to remove any air bubbles. Wipe the rims of the jars with a moist paper towel to remove any food residue. Top with lids and screw on rings.",
        "Place a rack in the bottom of a large stockpot and fill halfway with water. Bring to a boil and lower jars into the boiling water using a holder, spacing them 2 inches apart. Pour in more boiling water to cover jars by at least 1 inch. Bring the water to a rolling boil, cover the pot, and process for 10 minutes.",
        "Remove the jars from the stockpot and place onto a cloth-covered or wood surface, several inches apart, until cool, about 8 hours. Press the top of each lid with a finger, ensuring that the seal is tight (lid does not move up or down at all)."
