        "Reduce temperature to 325\u00b0 F. and baste turkey with pan juices. Add water to roasting pan and roast turkey, basting every 20 minutes, 2 1/2 to 3 hours more, or until a meat thermometer inserted in fleshy part of a thigh registers 180\u00b0 F. and juices run clear when thigh is pierced.
