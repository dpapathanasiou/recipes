Lightly brush tops of slices with about 1 tablespoon oil total and season with salt and pepper. Bake slices in middle of oven 5 minutes, or until golden, and transfer to a rack to cool.",
        "Separate garlic heads into cloves, discarding loose papery outer skin but keeping skin on cloves intact, and wrap together in foil, crimping seams to seal tightly. Roast garlic in middle of oven 30 minutes, or until soft. Unwrap garlic and cool slightly. Peel skin from each clove. Finely grate enough Parmigiano-Reggiano to measure 1/4 cup and chill remainder, wrapped in plastic wrap.",
        "In a saucepan cook peas in water, stirring, until just tender and heated through. In a food processor puree warm peas, garlic, grated cheese, lemon juice, 1 tablespoon oil, and salt and pepper to taste until smooth. Transfer puree to a bowl and cool completely. Puree may be made 1 day ahead and chilled, covered. Bring puree to room temperature before using and season with salt and pepper.",
