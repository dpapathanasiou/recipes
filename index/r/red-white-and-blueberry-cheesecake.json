        "On a flat surface, place one sheet of phyllo dough. Brush it with melted butter, and cover with another piece of phyllo. Repeat until all 8 sheets are used. Using kitchen scissors, cut layered phyllo into a 12- to 13-inch circle. Carefully press circle into a greased 9-inch pie plate; gently fan edges. Bake in preheated oven until edges are just golden, 6 to 8 minutes; cool slightly on a wire rack. Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).",

        "Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) until set, 40 to 50 minutes. To prevent the crust from over-browning, gently cover pie with foil for the last 25 minutes of baking. Cool completely on a wire rack.",
