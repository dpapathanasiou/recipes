        "Trim the ends from the rhubarb and cut into 6 inch lengths. Soak in a large bowl full of cold water for 20 minutes. Drain and pat dry, then cut crosswise into 1/2 inch slices.",
        "In a saucepan, stir together the orange juice, 1 cup of sugar and salt. Bring to a boil and add the rhubarb. Return to a boil, then set heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring only 2 or 3 times, until rhubarb is tender, 7 to 10 minutes. Stirring too much will cause the rhubarb to break down. Transfer the rhubarb mixture to a glass or ceramic bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Refrigerate until cold, at least 1 hour.",
        "Whip the heavy cream with the remaining sugar in a large bowl using an electric mixer until it can stand in a soft peak.",
        "To assemble the fools, spoon 1/4 cup of the rhubarb mixture into each of 8 small glasses. Cover with the same amount of whipped cream. Repeat layers until you reach the top of the glasses. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour and up to 6 hours before serving."
