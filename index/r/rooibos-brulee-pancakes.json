        "Steep the rooibos tea bags in the water for 5 minutes; remove tea bags and allow tea to cool.",
        "Heat a skillet over medium-low heat until a drop of water on the surface sizzles for a moment before disappearing. Whisk together 1 1/2 cups cooled tea with the pancake mix.",
        "Melt 1 teaspoon butter in the center of the skillet. Place 4 to 5 pecan halves into the melting butter. Pour about 1/3 cup pancake batter directly over pecans and butter. Sprinkle 1/2 tablespoon brown sugar over the top of the pancake, and add another thin pat of butter over the sugar.",
        "When the edges of the pancake appear dry and bubbles form on the top, turn and cook until lightly browned, about 40 seconds. Remove from pan; add any melted sugar from the pan to the top of the pancake. Repeat with remaining pancake mix, butter, pecans, and sugar."
