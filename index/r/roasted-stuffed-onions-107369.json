        "Cut a 1/2-inch-thick slice from tops of onions, discarding tops, and trim just enough from bottoms for onions to stand upright. Scoop out all but outer 2 or 3 layers from each using a small ice cream scoop or spoon (don't worry if you make a hole in the bottom), reserving scooped-out onion and onion shells separately.",

        "Add chopped onion, celery, salt, and pepper to skillet and saut\u00e9 over moderately high heat, stirring, until vegetables are softened, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and saut\u00e9, stirring, 1 minute. Transfer mixture to a large bowl and stir in spinach, bread, cashews, butter, 1 cup stock, and bacon, then cool completely.",
