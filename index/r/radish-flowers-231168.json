        "Trim radish tops, leaving 2 inches of stems with leaves attached. Trim roots, then wash radishes, cleaning well around stem end. Holding onto stem end of 1 radish and working with a sharp paring knife, carve a 1/8-inch-thick slice down one side, starting at root end, following shape of radish, and ending within 1/4 inch of stem to form a \"petal\" (do not cut all the way through). Make 2 more cuts around radish, turning it each time and leaving an equal amount of space between cuts, for a total of 3 petals. Repeat with remaining radishes.",
        "Soak radishes in a large bowl of ice and cold water at least 1 hour (to open \"flowers\"). Transfer radishes to paper towels to drain."
