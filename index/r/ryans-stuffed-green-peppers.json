        "Put 2 slices bacon into the cavity of each bell pepper so that the centers of each slice form a cross at the bottom and the strips run up the insides of the peppers. Fill the pepper with the ground beef mixture to the top and fold the ends of the bacon strips over the top of the beef filling. Arrange peppers into a baking dish.",
        "Bake in the preheated oven until beef filling is hot and grey in the center, about 1 hour. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 160 degrees F (70 degrees C)."
