        "Combine apple cider vinegar, soy sauce, water, brown sugar, Serrano peppers, ginger, and salt in a small saucepan. Bring mixture to a gentle boil over medium-high heat, stirring frequently. Continue cooking and stirring until reduced down by 1/3, about 20 minutes. The flavors will intensify as the sauce thickens and becomes syrupy. Divide the sauce, reserving 1 1/4 cups for serving.",
        "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).",
        "Rinse wings and pat dry. Place about a cup of crushed crackers in a bowl for breading.  Dip a chicken wing in the beaten egg and allow excess to drip off. Then coat chicken wing with RITZ cracker crumbs. Place chicken wing on a foil lined baking sheet. Repeat until all chicken is coated, adding more crushed crackers to bowl as needed.",
        "Heat cooking oil in a 2.5-quart saucepan to 375 degrees F. Carefully place 3 to 4 chicken wings in hot oil and fry until crispy, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove wings with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. Continue to fry the chicken in this manner until all are crispy.",
        "Lightly spray two foil lined baking sheets with cooking spray. Using 3/4 cups sauce, lightly coat each chicken wing and place on foil lined baking sheet in a single layer trying not to crowd the chicken.",
        "Place baking sheets in the preheated oven and bake until cooked through, 15 to 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Allow chicken to rest for 10 minutes; serve with reserved sauce, cucumber, carrots and enjoy!"
