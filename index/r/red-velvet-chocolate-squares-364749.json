        "1. Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F. Spray an 8 x 8 x 2-inch baking dish with cooking spray.",
        "2. Combine the beets, beans, cocoa powder, egg substitute, and flour in the bowl of a food processor. Process until the mixture is smooth, about 2 minutes, scraping down the bowl halfway through.",
        "3. Add the agave, butter, vanilla, almond extract, and food coloring. Process until all of the ingredients are combined, about 1 minute.",
        "4. Pour the batter into the prepared baking dish, and smooth the top with a spatula. Bake for 28-30 minutes, turning the dish halfway through the baking time. A toothpick inserted in the center will come out with soft batter clinging to it.",
        "5. Let the brownies cool completely in the baking dish on a wire rack. Then put them in the fridge for at least 3 hours. When they're cold, cut them into 12 squares and serve. Refrigerate any leftovers."
