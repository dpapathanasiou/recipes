        "In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment proof the yeast with the sugar in the water for 5 minutes, or until the mixture is foamy, add the flour, and table salt, and 3 tablespoons of the oil, and combine the dough well. With the dough hook knead the dough for 2 minutes, or until it is soft and slightly sticky. Form the dough into a ball, transfer it to an oiled bowl, and turn it to coat it with the oil. Let the dough rise, covered with plastic wrap, in a warm place for 1 1/2 hours, or until it is double in bulk. The dough may be made up to this point, punched down, and kept, covered and chilled, overnight. Let the dough return to room temperature before proceeding with the recipe. Press the dough evenly into an oiled jelly-roll pan, 15 1/2 by 10 1/2 by 1 inches, and let it rise, covered loosely, in a warm place for 1 hour, or until it is almost double in bulk.",
        "In a small bowl stir together the remaining 2 tablespoon oil, the garlic, and the chopped rosemary. Dimple the dough, making 1/4-inch deep indentations with your fingertips, brush it with the oil mixture, and sprinkle it with the coarse salt. Bake the focaccia in the bottom third of a preheated 400\u00b0F. oven for 35 to 45 minutes, or until it is golden brown, let it cool in the pan on a rack, and garnish it with the rosemary sprigs. Serve the focaccia warm or at room temperature."
