        "Whisk the soy sauce, vinegar, and sugar together in a bowl until the sugar is completely dissolved; pour into a large skillet and place over medium heat. Cook the chicken livers in the sauce until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 15 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Slice the livers into bite-sized pieces.",
