Set cup in 1-inch-deep simmering water in medium saucepan; stir until gelatin dissolves, about 3 minutes. Remove from heat. Using electric mixer, beat whipping cream and powdered sugar in large bowl just until mixture thickens. Gradually add warm gelatin mixture, beating until cream forms medium-firm peaks.
