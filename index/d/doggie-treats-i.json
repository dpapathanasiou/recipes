Combine the whole wheat flour, all purpose flour, cornmeal and powdered milk; stir into the cheese mixture until well blended. You may need to use your hand to properly blend the dough. On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough out to 1/4 inch thickness. Use a bone shaped cookie cutter to cut out the treats. Place them onto the prepared baking sheet 1 1/2 inches apart.",
