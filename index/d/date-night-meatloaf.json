        "Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Arrange peppers on a baking sheet.",
        "Broil peppers in the preheated oven until bubbling and skin becomes blackened, 5 to 10 minutes per side. Remove from oven and transfer peppers to a bowl of ice water; set aside for skin to loosen from peppers, about 10 minutes. Remove peppers from water and peel blackened skin from peppers and remove seeds.",

        "Place peppers and dates in a food processor; pulse until evenly combined.",
        "Mix pepper-date mixture, ground beef, goat cheese, 1/4 cup barbeque sauce, bread crumbs and egg together in a bowl or in a stand-mixer until evenly combined. Pour beef mixture into the prepared loaf pan. Spread 2 tablespoons barbeque sauce evenly over meat mixture.",
        "Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, about 1 hour. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C)."
