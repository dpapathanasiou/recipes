Stir in duck pieces; cook about 10 minutes, stirring frequently until lightly browned. Pour in 2 cups water, bring to a boil, and simmer 10 minutes. Pour in remaining water and vegetable oil; return contents to boil. Add rice to pot. Water should cover the rice by 1/2 inch. Return to a boil and cook, covered tightly, 15 to 20 minutes, until rice is tender.",
