        "Split the pumpkin in half, spoon out the seeds and place the pumpkin halves face down on a baking sheet. Split the potatoes lengthwise and place on the pan with the pumpkin. Bake the pumpkin and potatoes for 1 hour.  Remove them from the oven and let them cool. When the pumpkin has cooled, spoon out the flesh and put it into a large bowl. Cut the potato into 1/2 inch cubes.",
        "To make the dough in a food processor fitted with a steel blade, put the flour and salt into the processor. Add the butter. Run the machine in spurts until the butter is in bits no bigger than pea-size. Add 4 tablespoons ice water, and run the machine in spurts again just enough to bring the dough together. Turn the dough onto a work surface and knead it with your hands until the dough is soft and smooth, handling the dough as little as possible. Form it into a flattened ball. Chill the dough for at least 30 minutes.",
        "Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). On a floured surface, roll out the dough, and use it to line the bottom and sides of either a 9 inch square baking pan or a large deep dish pie pan. Pierce the dough with a fork in three places. Line the sides of the pan with aluminum foil, and crimp the foil gently to hold the dough in place.",
        "Bake the crust for 15 minutes. Remove the pan from the oven. Reduce the heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). While the crust bakes, make the filling.",
        "Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onions, and cook them, stirring frequently, until they soften, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic, and cook for 3 to 4 minutes more, stirring frequently. Add the corn and cook for 2 more minutes. Remove the skillet from the heat.",
        "Stir in the pumpkin, potato, cheese, thyme, allspice, salt, and pepper. Mix well, then spoon into pre-baked pie shell.",
        "Bake the pie at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 30 minutes or until veggies and cheese are piping hot. Serve immediately."
