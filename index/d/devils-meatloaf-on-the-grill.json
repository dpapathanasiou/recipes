        "Place the covered loaf pan on the grill away from direct heat. Cook for 30 minutes, then carefully remove foil and drain grease. Cover the pan with the foil, and return to the grill. Continue cooking until the meatloaf is no longer pink in the center, about 20 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 160 degrees F (70 degrees C)."
