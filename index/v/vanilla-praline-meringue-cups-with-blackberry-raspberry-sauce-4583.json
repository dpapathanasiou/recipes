        "Position 1 rack in bottom third and 1 rack in center of oven and preheat to 225\u00b0F. Using bottom of 2/3-cup souffl\u00e9 dish (measuring about 3 1/2 inches in diameter with 1 3/4-inch-high sides) as template, trace 3 circles on each of 2 large sheets of parchment paper, spacing 5 to 6 inches apart. Place parchment, marked side down, on baking sheets (circles will show through).",

Repeat with remaining meringue and foil hat. Slide spatula under each meringue cylinder with souffl\u00e9 dish still inside; place on sheets between meringue rounds (there will be 3 meringue round and 3 meringue cylinders on each sheet).",
        "Bake meringues until firm and dry, about 2 hours. Turn off oven; let meringues stand in closed oven 1 hour. Transfer baking sheets to racks and cool meringues completely.",
        "Lift meringue rounds off parchment; place on work surface. Lift foil with meringue cylinders to detach foil. Place 1 cylinder over each meringue round, forming cup. Mix toffee bits and nuts in small bowl. Spoon 1/4 cup ice cream into each meringue cup. Sprinkle with 1 tablespoon nut mixture. Top with 1/4 cup ice cream and 1 tablespoon nut mixture.
