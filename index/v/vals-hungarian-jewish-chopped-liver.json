        "In a large skillet, heat oil and butter over medium high heat. Saute the diced onion until fairly soft. Add chicken livers and saute over high heat, stirring frequently. When livers are cooked through (no longer pink inside and the juices run clear), remove livers and onions from heat and place in a large mixing bowl.",
        "Mash livers with a potato masher. You will need to use your fingers, removing the membranes as you go (the livers will be quite juicy; be sure to leave the juice in). In a separate bowl, mash the eggs and add to the liver. Add the grated or finely chopped raw onion  and chopped green onions and mix all together. The liver mixture should still be warm, and will slightly cook the onions. Season mixture with salt and pepper to taste and add at least 1 tablespoon paprika (more if desired, or if you're Hungarian!). Add 1 tablespoon chopped parsley. Mix well with a large spoon and refrigerate for 1 to 2 hours.",
        "To Serve: Place lettuce leaves on plates, top with chopped liver and sprinkle generously with paprika and 1 tablespoon fresh chopped parsley. Garnish with sprigs of fresh parsley. Enjoy!"
