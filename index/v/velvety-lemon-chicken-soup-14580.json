        "With a vegetable peeler remove two 2-inch-long strips zest from lemon and squeeze 1 teaspoon juice into a small cup. In a small saucepan simmer chicken and zest in broth, covered, 20 minutes, or until chicken is just cooked through. Transfer chicken to a bowl and pour broth through a sieve into a 4-cup measuring cup. Chill chicken until it is cool.",
        "While chicken is cooling, trim snow peas and cut diagonally into thin slivers. In a 2-quart saucepan heat butter over moderately low heat until foam subsides and stir in flour. Cook roux, stirring constantly, 2 minutes. Add broth and cream in a stream, whisking, and simmer, whisking, 2 minutes, or until soup thickens slightly. Remove pan from heat.",
        "When chicken is cool enough to handle, discard skin and bones and cut chicken into thin strips. Add chicken and snow peas to soup and simmer, stirring occasionally, 1 minute, or until peas are crisp-tender. Stir in lemon juice, parsley, and salt and pepper to taste."
