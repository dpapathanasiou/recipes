        "Meanwhile, stir together the elk meat, Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper in a skillet over medium-high heat until crumbly and no longer pink, about 5 minutes. Spread the cooked elk meat into a 9-inch pie plate or baking dish and return the skillet to the stove over medium heat.",
        "Place the onion, parsnip, and garlic powder in the skillet, season to taste with salt and pepper, and cook until the turnip has softened, about 10 minutes. Stir in the mixed vegetables and cook an additional 5 minutes, then spread in the pie plate over the elk. Finally, spread the mashed potatoes evenly over the top, and brush the melted butter on the potatoes.",
