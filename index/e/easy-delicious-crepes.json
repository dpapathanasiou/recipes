        "Beat eggs, soy milk, and olive oil together in a small bowl. Mix all-purpose flour, whole-wheat flour, flax seeds, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg together in a separate bowl. Stir the egg mixture into flour mixture until well mixed.",
        "Heat a lightly oiled skillet over medium heat. Pour about 1/4 the batter in the hot skillet and cook until batter turns from wet to moist, and the edges begin to curl away from the sides of the skillet, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip and continue cooking until lightly golden on the other side, 1 to 2 minutes.",
        "Place cooked crepe onto a plate, and cover with a kitchen towel to keep moist. Repeat with the remaining batter, lightly oiling the skillet as needed to keep the crepes from sticking."
