        "Mix water, yeast, and salt together in a large bowl until mixture becomes foamy, about 10 minutes. Stir flour into yeast mixture until well incorporated. The dough will be loose and look wet. Cover bowl loosely with a damp towel and let sit for about 5 hours.",
        "Shape dough into 2 loaves using damp hands. Place loaves on a cornmeal-dusted work surface and score the tops a few times with a sharp knife. Allow loaves to double in size, 30 to 60 minutes.",
        "Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Place loaves on a baking sheet.",
        "Bake in the preheated oven, spraying the surface of the dough occasionally with water, until golden brown, about 20 minutes."
