        "Bring a large pot of water to a boil.  Add the chicken and simmer until cooked through, approximately 10 minutes.  Drain, cool and cut into cubes.",
        "While boiling chicken, make the mayonnaise:  Using a blender or hand-held electric mixer, beat the egg, mustard, salt, water and vinegar until light and frothy.  Add the oil a tablespoon at a time, beating thoroughly after each addition.  Once mixture begins to thicken, you can add oil more quickly.  Continue until mixture reaches the consistency of creamy mayonnaise.    NOTE: The more oil you add, the thicker it gets; you may not need the full cup of oil.",
        "In a large bowl, toss together the chicken, grapes, pecans, blue cheese and 1 cup of the mayonnaise.  Stir until evenly coated, adding more mayonnaise if necessary.  Refrigerate until serving."
